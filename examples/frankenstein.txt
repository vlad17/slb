st  petersburgh  dec  11th  17     
 
 
you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the 
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil 
forebodings  i arrived here yesterday  and my first task is to assure 
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success 
of my undertaking  
 
i am already far north of london  and as i walk in the streets of 
petersburgh  i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks  which 
braces my nerves and fills me with delight  do you understand this 
feeling  this breeze  which has travelled from the regions towards 
which i am advancing  gives me a foretaste of those icy climes  
inspirited by this wind of promise  my daydreams become more fervent 
and vivid  i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of 
frost and desolation  it ever presents itself to my imagination as the 
region of beauty and delight  there  margaret  the sun is for ever 
visible  its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a 
perpetual splendour  there   for with your leave  my sister  i will put 
some trust in preceding navigators   there snow and frost are banished  
and  sailing over a calm sea  we may be wafted to a land surpassing in 
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable 
globe  its productions and features may be without example  as the 
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered 
solitudes  what may not be expected in a country of eternal light  i 
may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may 
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this 
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever  i 
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world 
never before visited  and may tread a land never before imprinted by 
the foot of man  these are my enticements  and they are sufficient to 
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this 
laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little 
boat  with his holiday mates  on an expedition of discovery up his 
native river  but supposing all these conjectures to be false  you 
cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all 
mankind  to the last generation  by discovering a passage near the pole 
to those countries  to reach which at present so many months are 
requisite  or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet  which  if at 
all possible  can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine  
 
these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my 
letter  and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me 
to heaven  for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as 
a steady purpose   a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual 
eye  this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years  i 
have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have 
been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean 
through the seas which surround the pole  you may remember that a 
history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the 
whole of our good uncle thomas    library  my education was neglected  
yet i was passionately fond of reading  these volumes were my study 
day and night  and my familiarity with them increased that regret which 
i had felt  as a child  on learning that my father   s dying injunction 
had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life  
 
these visions faded when i perused  for the first time  those poets 
whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven  i also 
became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation  
i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the 
names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated  you are well 
acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment  
but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin  and my 
thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent  
 
six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking  i 
can  even now  remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this 
great enterprise  i commenced by inuring my body to hardship  i 
accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea  
i voluntarily endured cold  famine  thirst  and want of sleep  i often 
worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my 
nights to the study of mathematics  the theory of medicine  and those 
branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive 
the greatest practical advantage  twice i actually hired myself as an 
under-mate in a greenland whaler  and acquitted myself to admiration  i 
must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second 
dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest 
earnestness  so valuable did he consider my services  
 
and now  dear margaret  do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose  
my life might have been passed in ease and luxury  but i preferred glory to 
every enticement that wealth placed in my path  oh  that some encouraging 
voice would answer in the affirmative  my courage and my resolution is 
firm  but my hopes fluctuate  and my spirits are often depressed  i am 
about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage  the emergencies of which 
will demand all my fortitude  i am required not only to raise the spirits 
of others  but sometimes to sustain my own  when theirs are failing  
 
this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia  they fly 
quickly over the snow in their sledges  the motion is pleasant  and  in 
my opinion  far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach  the 
cold is not excessive  if you are wrapped in furs   a dress which i have 
already adopted  for there is a great difference between walking the 
deck and remaining seated motionless for hours  when no exercise 
prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins  i have no 
ambition to lose my life on the post-road between st  petersburgh and 
archangel  
 
i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks  and my 
intention is to hire a ship there  which can easily be done by paying the 
insurance for the owner  and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary 
among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing  i do not intend to 
sail until the month of june  and when shall i return  ah  dear sister  how 
can i answer this question  if i succeed  many  many months  perhaps years  
will pass before you and i may meet  if i fail  you will see me again soon  
or never  
 
farewell  my dear  excellent margaret  heaven shower down blessings on you  
and save me  that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your 
love and kindness  
 
your affectionate brother

letter 2 
 
 to mrs  saville  england   
 
archangel  28th march  17     
 
 
how slowly the time passes here  encompassed as i am by frost and snow  
yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise  i have hired a 
vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors  those whom i have 
already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly 
possessed of dauntless courage  
 
but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy  and the 
absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil  i have no 
friend  margaret  when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success  there 
will be none to participate my joy  if i am assailed by disappointment  no 
one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection  i shall commit my thoughts 
to paper  it is true  but that is a poor medium for the communication of 
feeling  i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me  whose 
eyes would reply to mine  you may deem me romantic  my dear sister  but i 
bitterly feel the want of a friend  i have no one near me  gentle yet 
courageous  possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind  whose 
tastes are like my own  to approve or amend my plans  how would such a 
friend repair the faults of your poor brother  i am too ardent in execution 
and too impatient of difficulties  but it is a still greater evil to me 
that i am self-educated  for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild 
on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas    books of voyages  
at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own 
country  but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its 
most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the 
necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native 
country  now i am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many 
schoolboys of fifteen  it is true that i have thought more and that my 
daydreams are more extended and magnificent  but they want  as the painters 
call it   keeping   and i greatly need a friend who would have sense 
enough not to despise me as romantic  and affection enough for me to 
endeavour to regulate my mind  
 
well  these are useless complaints  i shall certainly find no friend on the 
wide ocean  nor even here in archangel  among merchants and seamen  yet 
some feelings  unallied to the dross of human nature  beat even in these 
rugged bosoms  my lieutenant  for instance  is a man of wonderful courage 
and enterprise  he is madly desirous of glory  or rather  to word my phrase 
more characteristically  of advancement in his profession  he is an 
englishman  and in the midst of national and professional prejudices  
unsoftened by cultivation  retains some of the noblest endowments of 
humanity  i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel  
finding that he was unemployed in this city  i easily engaged him to assist 
in my enterprise  
 
the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the 
ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline  this 
circumstance  added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage  made 
me very desirous to engage him  a youth passed in solitude  my best years 
spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage  has so refined the 
groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to 
the usual brutality exercised on board ship  i have never believed it to be 
necessary  and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness 
of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew  i felt 
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services  i heard 
of him first in rather a romantic manner  from a lady who owes to him the 
happiness of her life  this  briefly  is his story  some years ago he loved 
a young russian lady of moderate fortune  and having amassed a considerable 
sum in prize-money  the father of the girl consented to the match  he saw 
his mistress once before the destined ceremony  but she was bathed in 
tears  and throwing herself at his feet  entreated him to spare her  
confessing at the same time that she loved another  but that he was poor  
and that her father would never consent to the union  my generous friend 
reassured the suppliant  and on being informed of the name of her lover  
instantly abandoned his pursuit  he had already bought a farm with his 
money  on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life  but he 
bestowed the whole on his rival  together with the remains of his 
prize-money to purchase stock  and then himself solicited the young 
woman   s father to consent to her marriage with her lover  but the old 
man decidedly refused  thinking himself bound in honour to my friend  who  
when he found the father inexorable  quitted his country  nor returned 
until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her 
inclinations     what a noble fellow     you will exclaim  he is 
so  but then he is wholly uneducated  he is as silent as a turk  and a kind 
of ignorant carelessness attends him  which  while it renders his conduct 
the more astonishing  detracts from the interest and sympathy which 
otherwise he would command  
 
yet do not suppose  because i complain a little or because i can 
conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know  that i am 
wavering in my resolutions  those are as fixed as fate  and my voyage 
is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation  the 
winter has been dreadfully severe  but the spring promises well  and it 
is considered as a remarkably early season  so that perhaps i may sail 
sooner than i expected  i shall do nothing rashly  you know me 
sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the 
safety of others is committed to my care  
 
i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my 
undertaking  it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of 
the trembling sensation  half pleasurable and half fearful  with which 
i am preparing to depart  i am going to unexplored regions  to    the 
land of mist and snow     but i shall kill no albatross  therefore do not 
be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and 
woeful as the    ancient mariner     you will smile at my allusion  but i 
will disclose a secret  i have often attributed my attachment to  my 
passionate enthusiasm for  the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that 
production of the most imaginative of modern poets  there is something 
at work in my soul which i do not understand  i am practically 
industrious   painstaking  a workman to execute with perseverance and 
labour   but besides this there is a love for the marvellous  a belief 
in the marvellous  intertwined in all my projects  which hurries me out 
of the common pathways of men  even to the wild sea and unvisited 
regions i am about to explore  
 
but to return to dearer considerations  shall i meet you again  after 
having traversed immense seas  and returned by the most southern cape of 
africa or america  i dare not expect such success  yet i cannot bear to 
look on the reverse of the picture  continue for the present to write to 
me by every opportunity  i may receive your letters on some occasions when 
i need them most to support my spirits  i love you very tenderly   
remember me with affection  should you never hear from me again  
 
your affectionate brother  
 robert walton 
 
 
 
 
letter 3

my dear sister  
 
i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe   and well advanced 
on my voyage  this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on 
its homeward voyage from archangel  more fortunate than i  who may not 
see my native land  perhaps  for many years  i am  however  in good 
spirits  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose  nor do the 
floating sheets of ice that continually pass us  indicating the dangers 
of the region towards which we are advancing  appear to dismay them  we 
have already reached a very high latitude  but it is the height of 
summer  and although not so warm as in england  the southern gales  
which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire 
to attain  breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not 
expected  
 
no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a 
letter  one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are 
accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record  and 
i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage  
 
adieu  my dear margaret  be assured that for my own sake  as well as 
yours  i will not rashly encounter danger  i will be cool  
persevering  and prudent  
 
but success  shall  crown my endeavours  wherefore not  thus far i 
have gone  tracing a secure way over the pathless seas  the very stars 
themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph  why not 
still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element  what can stop the 
determined heart and resolved will of man  
 
my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus  but i must 
finish  heaven bless my beloved sister

august 5th  17     
 
so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear 
recording it  although it is very probable that you will see me before 
these papers can come into your possession  
 
last monday  july 31st  we were nearly surrounded by ice  which closed 
in the ship on all sides  scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which 
she floated  our situation was somewhat dangerous  especially as we 
were compassed round by a very thick fog  we accordingly lay to  
hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather  
 
about two o   clock the mist cleared away  and we beheld  stretched out 
in every direction  vast and irregular plains of ice  which seemed to 
have no end  some of my comrades groaned  and my own mind began to 
grow watchful with anxious thoughts  when a strange sight suddenly 
attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own 
situation  we perceived a low carriage  fixed on a sledge and drawn by 
dogs  pass on towards the north  at the distance of half a mile  a 
being which had the shape of a man  but apparently of gigantic stature  
sat in the sledge and guided the dogs  we watched the rapid progress 
of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the 
distant inequalities of the ice  
 
this appearance excited our unqualified wonder  we were  as we believed  
many hundred miles from any land  but this apparition seemed to denote that 
it was not  in reality  so distant as we had supposed  shut in  however  by 
ice  it was impossible to follow his track  which we had observed with the 
greatest attention  
 
about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea  and before 
night the ice broke and freed our ship  we  however  lay to until the 
morning  fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which 
float about after the breaking up of the ice  i profited of this time to 
rest for a few hours  
 
in the morning  however  as soon as it was light  i went upon deck and 
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel  apparently 
talking to someone in the sea  it was  in fact  a sledge  like that we 
had seen before  which had drifted towards us in the night on a large 
fragment of ice  only one dog remained alive  but there was a human 
being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel  
he was not  as the other traveller seemed to be  a savage inhabitant of 
some undiscovered island  but a european  when i appeared on deck the 
master said     here is our captain  and he will not allow you to perish 
on the open sea     
 
on perceiving me  the stranger addressed me in english  although with a 
foreign accent     before i come on board your vessel     said he  
   will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound     
 
you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed 
to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have 
supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not 
have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford  i 
replied  however  that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the 
northern pole  
 
upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board  
good god  margaret  if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for 
his safety  your surprise would have been boundless  his limbs were 
nearly frozen  and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and 
suffering  i never saw a man in so wretched a condition  we attempted 
to carry him into the cabin  but as soon as he had quitted the fresh 
air he fainted  we accordingly brought him back to the deck and 
restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to 
swallow a small quantity  as soon as he showed signs of life we 
wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the 
kitchen stove  by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup  
which restored him wonderfully  
 
two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak  and i often 
feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding  when he 
had in some measure recovered  i removed him to my own cabin and 
attended on him as much as my duty would permit  i never saw a more 
interesting creature  his eyes have generally an expression of 
wildness  and even madness  but there are moments when  if anyone 
performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most 
trifling service  his whole countenance is lighted up  as it were  with 
a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled  but he 
is generally melancholy and despairing  and sometimes he gnashes his 
teeth  as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him  
 
when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off 
the men  who wished to ask him a thousand questions  but i would not 
allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity  in a state of body 
and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose  
once  however  the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice 
in so strange a vehicle  
 
his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom  and 
he replied     to seek one who fled from me     
 
   and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion     
 
   yes     
 
   then i fancy we have seen him  for the day before we picked you up we 
saw some dogs drawing a sledge  with a man in it  across the ice     
 
this aroused the stranger   s attention  and he asked a multitude of 
questions concerning the route which the d  mon  as he called him  had 
pursued  soon after  when he was alone with me  he said     i have  
doubtless  excited your curiosity  as well as that of these good 
people  but you are too considerate to make inquiries     
 
   certainly  it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to 
trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine     
 
   and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation  you have 
benevolently restored me to life     
 
soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the 
ice had destroyed the other sledge  i replied that i could not answer 
with any degree of certainty  for the ice had not broken until near 
midnight  and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety 
before that time  but of this i could not judge  
 
from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the 
stranger  he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for 
the sledge which had before appeared  but i have persuaded him to remain in 
the cabin  for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere  
i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant 
notice if any new object should appear in sight  
 
such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the 
present day  the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very 
silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin  
yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all 
interested in him  although they have had very little communication 
with him  for my own part  i begin to love him as a brother  and his 
constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion  he must 
have been a noble creature in his better days  being even now in wreck 
so attractive and amiable  
 
i said in one of my letters  my dear margaret  that i should find no friend 
on the wide ocean  yet i have found a man who  before his spirit had been 
broken by misery  i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother 
of my heart  
 
i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals  
should i have any fresh incidents to record  
 
 
 
 
august 13th  17     
 
 
my affection for my guest increases every day  he excites at once my 
admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree  how can i see so 
noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant 
grief  he is so gentle  yet so wise  his mind is so cultivated  and 
when he speaks  although his words are culled with the choicest art  
yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence  
 
he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck  
apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own  yet  although 
unhappy  he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he 
interests himself deeply in the projects of others  he has frequently 
conversed with me on mine  which i have communicated to him without 
disguise  he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my 
eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken 
to secure it  i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the 
language of my heart  to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul 
and to say  with all the fervour that warmed me  how gladly i would 
sacrifice my fortune  my existence  my every hope  to the furtherance of my 
enterprise  one man   s life or death were but a small price to pay for 
the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought  for the dominion i should 
acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race  as i spoke  a 
dark gloom spread over my listener   s countenance  at first i 
perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion  he placed his hands before 
his eyes  and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle 
fast from between his fingers  a groan burst from his heaving breast  i 
paused  at length he spoke  in broken accents     unhappy man  do you 
share my madness  have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught  hear me  
let me reveal my tale  and you will dash the cup from your lips     
 
such words  you may imagine  strongly excited my curiosity  but the 
paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened 
powers  and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were 
necessary to restore his composure  
 
having conquered the violence of his feelings  he appeared to despise 
himself for being the slave of passion  and quelling the dark tyranny of 
despair  he led me again to converse concerning myself personally  he asked 
me the history of my earlier years  the tale was quickly told  but it 
awakened various trains of reflection  i spoke of my desire of finding a 
friend  of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than 
had ever fallen to my lot  and expressed my conviction that a man could 
boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing  
 
   i agree with you     replied the stranger     we are 
unfashioned creatures  but half made up  if one wiser  better  dearer than 
ourselves   such a friend ought to be   do not lend his aid to 
perfectionate our weak and faulty natures  i once had a friend  the most 
noble of human creatures  and am entitled  therefore  to judge respecting 
friendship  you have hope  and the world before you  and have no cause for 
despair  but i   i have lost everything and cannot begin life 
anew     
 
as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm  settled 
grief that touched me to the heart  but he was silent and presently 
retired to his cabin  
 
even broken in spirit as he is  no one can feel more deeply than he 
does the beauties of nature  the starry sky  the sea  and every sight 
afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of 
elevating his soul from earth  such a man has a double existence  he 
may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments  yet when he 
has retired into himself  he will be like a celestial spirit that has a 
halo around him  within whose circle no grief or folly ventures  
 
will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine 
wanderer  you would not if you saw him  you have been tutored and 
refined by books and retirement from the world  and you are therefore 
somewhat fastidious  but this only renders you the more fit to 
appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man  sometimes i 
have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that 
elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew  i 
believe it to be an intuitive discernment  a quick but never-failing 
power of judgment  a penetration into the causes of things  unequalled 
for clearness and precision  add to this a facility of expression and a 
voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music  
 
 
 
 
august 19th  17     
 
 
yesterday the stranger said to me     you may easily perceive  captain 
walton  that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes  i had 
determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with 
me  but you have won me to alter my determination  you seek for 
knowledge and wisdom  as i once did  and i ardently hope that the 
gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you  as mine 
has been  i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be 
useful to you  yet  when i reflect that you are pursuing the same 
course  exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me 
what i am  i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale  one 
that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you 
in case of failure  prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually 
deemed marvellous  were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might 
fear to encounter your unbelief  perhaps your ridicule  but many things 
will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would 
provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers 
of nature  nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series 
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed     
 
you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered 
communication  yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by 
a recital of his misfortunes  i felt the greatest eagerness to hear 
the promised narrative  partly from curiosity and partly from a strong 
desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power  i expressed 
these feelings in my answer  
 
   i thank you     he replied     for your sympathy  but it is 
useless  my fate is nearly fulfilled  i wait but for one event  and then i 
shall repose in peace  i understand your feeling     continued he  
perceiving that i wished to interrupt him     but you are mistaken  my 
friend  if thus you will allow me to name you  nothing can alter my 
destiny  listen to my history  and you will perceive how irrevocably it is 
determined     
 
he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i 
should be at leisure  this promise drew from me the warmest thanks  i have 
resolved every night  when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties  to 
record  as nearly as possible in his own words  what he has related during 
the day  if i should be engaged  i will at least make notes  this 
manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure  but to me  who 
know him  and who hear it from his own lips   with what interest and 
sympathy shall i read it in some future day  even now  as i commence my 
task  his full-toned voice swells in my ears  his lustrous eyes dwell on me 
with all their melancholy sweetness  i see his thin hand raised in 
animation  while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul 
within  strange and harrowing must be his story  frightful the storm which 
embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it   thus  
 
 
 
 
chapter 1 
 
 
i am by birth a genevese  and my family is one of the most 
distinguished of that republic  my ancestors had been for many years 
counsellors and syndics  and my father had filled several public 
situations with honour and reputation  he was respected by all who 
knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public 
business  he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the 
affairs of his country  a variety of circumstances had prevented his 
marrying early  nor was it until the decline of life that he became a 
husband and the father of a family  
 
as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character  i cannot 
refrain from relating them  one of his most intimate friends was a 
merchant who  from a flourishing state  fell  through numerous 
mischances  into poverty  this man  whose name was beaufort  was of a 
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty 
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been 
distinguished for his rank and magnificence  having paid his debts  
therefore  in the most honourable manner  he retreated with his 
daughter to the town of lucerne  where he lived unknown and in 
wretchedness  my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and 
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances  
he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct 
so little worthy of the affection that united them  he lost no time in 
endeavouring to seek him out  with the hope of persuading him to begin 
the world again through his credit and assistance  
 
beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself  and it was ten 
months before my father discovered his abode  overjoyed at this discovery  
he hastened to the house  which was situated in a mean street near the 
reuss  but when he entered  misery and despair alone welcomed him  beaufort 
had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes  but 
it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months  and in 
the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a 
merchant   s house  the interval was  consequently  spent in inaction  
his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for 
reflection  and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end 
of three months he lay on a bed of sickness  incapable of any exertion  
 
his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness  but she saw 
with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that 
there was no other prospect of support  but caroline beaufort 
possessed a mind of an uncommon mould  and her courage rose to support 
her in her adversity  she procured plain work  she plaited straw and 
by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to 
support life  
 
several months passed in this manner  her father grew worse  her time 
was more entirely occupied in attending him  her means of subsistence 
decreased  and in the tenth month her father died in her arms  leaving 
her an orphan and a beggar  this last blow overcame her  and she knelt 
by beaufort   s coffin weeping bitterly  when my father entered the 
chamber  he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl  who 
committed herself to his care  and after the interment of his friend he 
conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a 
relation  two years after this event caroline became his wife  
 
there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents  but 
this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted 
affection  there was a sense of justice in my father   s upright mind 
which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love 
strongly  perhaps during former years he had suffered from the 
late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set 
a greater value on tried worth  there was a show of gratitude and 
worship in his attachment to my mother  differing wholly from the 
doting fondness of age  for it was inspired by reverence for her 
virtues and a desire to be the means of  in some degree  recompensing 
her for the sorrows she had endured  but which gave inexpressible grace 
to his behaviour to her  everything was made to yield to her wishes 
and her convenience  he strove to shelter her  as a fair exotic is 
sheltered by the gardener  from every rougher wind and to surround her 
with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and 
benevolent mind  her health  and even the tranquillity of her hitherto 
constant spirit  had been shaken by what she had gone through  during 
the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had 
gradually relinquished all his public functions  and immediately after 
their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy  and the change 
of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders  
as a restorative for her weakened frame  
 
from italy they visited germany and france  i  their eldest child  was born 
at naples  and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles  i remained 
for several years their only child  much as they were attached to each 
other  they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very 
mine of love to bestow them upon me  my mother   s tender caresses and 
my father   s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my 
first recollections  i was their plaything and their idol  and something 
better   their child  the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on 
them by heaven  whom to bring up to good  and whose future lot it was in 
their hands to direct to happiness or misery  according as they fulfilled 
their duties towards me  with this deep consciousness of what they owed 
towards the being to which they had given life  added to the active spirit 
of tenderness that animated both  it may be imagined that while during 
every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience  of charity  
and of self-control  i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but 
one train of enjoyment to me  
 
for a long time i was their only care  my mother had much desired to have a 
daughter  but i continued their single offspring  when i was about five 
years old  while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy  they 
passed a week on the shores of the lake of como  their benevolent 
disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor  this  to my 
mother  was more than a duty  it was a necessity  a 
passion   remembering what she had suffered  and how she had been 
relieved   for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the 
afflicted  during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale 
attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate  while the number 
of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst 
shape  one day  when my father had gone by himself to milan  my mother  
accompanied by me  visited this abode  she found a peasant and his wife  
hard working  bent down by care and labour  distributing a scanty meal to 
five hungry babes  among these there was one which attracted my mother far 
above all the rest  she appeared of a different stock  the four others were 
dark-eyed  hardy little vagrants  this child was thin and very fair  her 
hair was the brightest living gold  and despite the poverty of her 
clothing  seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head  her brow was 
clear and ample  her blue eyes cloudless  and her lips and the moulding of 
her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold 
her without looking on her as of a distinct species  a being heaven-sent  
and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features  
 
the peasant woman  perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and 
admiration on this lovely girl  eagerly communicated her history  she was 
not her child  but the daughter of a milanese nobleman  her mother was a 
german and had died on giving her birth  the infant had been placed with 
these good people to nurse  they were better off then  they had not been 
long married  and their eldest child was but just born  the father of their 
charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory 
of italy   one among the  schiavi ognor frementi   who exerted 
himself to obtain the liberty of his country  he became the victim of its 
weakness  whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria 
was not known  his property was confiscated  his child became an orphan and 
a beggar  she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude 
abode  fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles  
 
when my father returned from milan  he found playing with me in the hall of 
our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub   a creature who seemed 
to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter 
than the chamois of the hills  the apparition was soon explained  with his 
permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their 
charge to her  they were fond of the sweet orphan  her presence had seemed 
a blessing to them  but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty 
and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection  they 
consulted their village priest  and the result was that elizabeth lavenza 
became the inmate of my parents    house   my more than 
sister   the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and 
my pleasures  
 
everyone loved elizabeth  the passionate and almost reverential 
attachment with which all regarded her became  while i shared it  my 
pride and my delight  on the evening previous to her being brought to 
my home  my mother had said playfully     i have a pretty present for my 
victor   tomorrow he shall have it     and when  on the morrow  she 
presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift  i  with childish 
seriousness  interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth 
as mine   mine to protect  love  and cherish  all praises bestowed on 
her i received as made to a possession of my own  we called each other 
familiarly by the name of cousin  no word  no expression could body 
forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me   my more than 
sister  since till death she was to be mine only  
 
 
 
 
chapter 2 
 
 
we were brought up together  there was not quite a year difference in 
our ages  i need not say that we were strangers to any species of 
disunion or dispute  harmony was the soul of our companionship  and 
the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us 
nearer together  elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated 
disposition  but  with all my ardour  i was capable of a more intense 
application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge  
she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets  
and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss 
home    the sublime shapes of the mountains  the changes of the seasons  
tempest and calm  the silence of winter  and the life and turbulence of 
our alpine summers   she found ample scope for admiration and delight  
while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the 
magnificent appearances of things  i delighted in investigating their 
causes  the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine  
curiosity  earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature  
gladness akin to rapture  as they were unfolded to me  are among the 
earliest sensations i can remember  
 
on the birth of a second son  my junior by seven years  my parents gave 
up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native 
country  we possessed a house in geneva  and a  campagne  on belrive  
the eastern shore of the lake  at the distance of rather more than a 
league from the city  we resided principally in the latter  and the 
lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion  it was my 
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few  i was 
indifferent  therefore  to my school-fellows in general  but i united 
myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them  henry 
clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva  he was a boy of singular 
talent and fancy  he loved enterprise  hardship  and even danger for 
its own sake  he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance  he 
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and 
knightly adventure  he tried to make us act plays and to enter into 
masquerades  in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of 
roncesvalles  of the round table of king arthur  and the chivalrous 
train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands 
of the infidels  
 
no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself  my 
parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence  
we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to 
their caprice  but the agents and creators of all the many delights 
which we enjoyed  when i mingled with other families i distinctly 
discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was  and gratitude assisted 
the development of filial love  
 
my temper was sometimes violent  and my passions vehement  but by some 
law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits 
but to an eager desire to learn  and not to learn all things 
indiscriminately  i confess that neither the structure of languages  
nor the code of governments  nor the politics of various states 
possessed attractions for me  it was the secrets of heaven and earth 
that i desired to learn  and whether it was the outward substance of 
things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man 
that occupied me  still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical  
or in its highest sense  the physical secrets of the world  
 
meanwhile clerval occupied himself  so to speak  with the moral 
relations of things  the busy stage of life  the virtues of heroes  
and the actions of men were his theme  and his hope and his dream was 
to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the 
gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species  the saintly soul 
of elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home  
her sympathy was ours  her smile  her soft voice  the sweet glance of 
her celestial eyes  were ever there to bless and animate us  she was 
the living spirit of love to soften and attract  i might have become 
sullen in my study  rough through the ardour of my nature  but that 
she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness  and 
clerval   could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval  yet 
he might not have been so perfectly humane  so thoughtful in his 
generosity  so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for 
adventurous exploit  had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of 
beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring 
ambition  
 
i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood  
before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of 
extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self  besides  
in drawing the picture of my early days  i also record those events which 
led  by insensible steps  to my after tale of misery  for when i would 
account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my 
destiny i find it arise  like a mountain river  from ignoble and almost 
forgotten sources  but  swelling as it proceeded  it became the torrent 
which  in its course  has swept away all my hopes and joys  
 
natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate  i desire  
therefore  in this narration  to state those facts which led to my 
predilection for that science  when i was thirteen years of age we all went 
on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon  the inclemency of the 
weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn  in this house i 
chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa  i opened it 
with apathy  the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful 
facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm  a new 
light seemed to dawn upon my mind  and bounding with joy  i communicated my 
discovery to my father  my father looked carelessly at the title page of my 
book and said     ah  cornelius agrippa  my dear victor  do not waste 
your time upon this  it is sad trash     
 
if  instead of this remark  my father had taken the pains to explain to me 
that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern 
system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers 
than the ancient  because the powers of the latter were chimerical  while 
those of the former were real and practical  under such circumstances i 
should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my 
imagination  warmed as it was  by returning with greater ardour to my 
former studies  it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never 
have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin  but the cursory glance 
my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was 
acquainted with its contents  and i continued to read with the greatest 
avidity  
 
when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this 
author  and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus  i read and 
studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight  they appeared to me 
treasures known to few besides myself  i have described myself as always 
having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of 
nature  in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern 
philosophers  i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied  
sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking 
up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth  those of his 
successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted 
appeared even to my boy   s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same 
pursuit  
 
the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted 
with their practical uses  the most learned philosopher knew little 
more  he had partially unveiled the face of nature  but her immortal 
lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery  he might dissect  
anatomise  and give names  but  not to speak of a final cause  causes 
in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him  i 
had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep 
human beings from entering the citadel of nature  and rashly and 
ignorantly i had repined  
 
but here were books  and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew 
more  i took their word for all that they averred  and i became their 
disciple  it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth 
century  but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of 
geneva  i was  to a great degree  self-taught with regard to my favourite 
studies  my father was not scientific  and i was left to struggle with a 
child   s blindness  added to a student   s thirst for knowledge  
under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest 
diligence into the search of the philosopher   s stone and the elixir 
of life  but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention  wealth was an 
inferior object  but what glory would attend the discovery if i could 
banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but 
a violent death  
 
nor were these my only visions  the raising of ghosts or devils was a 
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors  the fulfilment of which 
i most eagerly sought  and if my incantations were always unsuccessful  i 
attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a 
want of skill or fidelity in my instructors  and thus for a time i was 
occupied by exploded systems  mingling  like an unadept  a thousand 
contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of 
multifarious knowledge  guided by an ardent imagination and childish 
reasoning  till an accident again changed the current of my ideas  
 
when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near 
belrive  when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm  it 
advanced from behind the mountains of jura  and the thunder burst at once 
with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens  i remained  
while the storm lasted  watching its progress with curiosity and delight  
as i stood at the door  on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an 
old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house  and so 
soon as the dazzling light vanished  the oak had disappeared  and nothing 
remained but a blasted stump  when we visited it the next morning  we found 
the tree shattered in a singular manner  it was not splintered by the 
shock  but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood  i never beheld 
anything so utterly destroyed  
 
before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of 
electricity  on this occasion a man of great research in natural 
philosophy was with us  and excited by this catastrophe  he entered on 
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of 
electricity and galvanism  which was at once new and astonishing to me  
all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa  
albertus magnus  and paracelsus  the lords of my imagination  but by 
some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my 
accustomed studies  it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever 
be known  all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew 
despicable  by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps 
most subject to in early youth  i at once gave up my former 
occupations  set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed 
and abortive creation  and entertained the greatest disdain for a 
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of 
real knowledge  in this mood of mind i betook myself to the 
mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as 
being built upon secure foundations  and so worthy of my consideration  
 
thus strangely are our souls constructed  and by such slight ligaments 
are we bound to prosperity or ruin  when i look back  it seems to me 
as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the 
immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life   the last effort 
made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even 
then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me  her victory was 
announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which 
followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting 
studies  it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with 
their prosecution  happiness with their disregard  
 
it was a strong effort of the spirit of good  but it was ineffectual  
destiny was too potent  and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and 
terrible destruction  
 
 
 
 
chapter 3 
 
 
when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i 
should become a student at the university of ingolstadt  i had 
hitherto attended the schools of geneva  but my father thought it 
necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made 
acquainted with other customs than those of my native country  my 
departure was therefore fixed at an early date  but before the day 
resolved upon could arrive  the first misfortune of my life 
occurred   an omen  as it were  of my future misery  
 
elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever  her illness was severe  and she was 
in the greatest danger  during her illness many arguments had been urged to 
persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her  she had at first 
yielded to our entreaties  but when she heard that the life of her 
favourite was menaced  she could no longer control her anxiety  she 
attended her sickbed  her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity 
of the distemper   elizabeth was saved  but the consequences of this 
imprudence were fatal to her preserver  on the third day my mother 
sickened  her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms  and the 
looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event  on her 
deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert 
her  she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself     my 
children     she said     my firmest hopes of future happiness were 
placed on the prospect of your union  this expectation will now be the 
consolation of your father  elizabeth  my love  you must supply my place to 
my younger children  alas  i regret that i am taken from you  and  happy 
and beloved as i have been  is it not hard to quit you all  but these are 
not thoughts befitting me  i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to 
death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world     
 
she died calmly  and her countenance expressed affection even in death  
i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent 
by that most irreparable evil  the void that presents itself to the 
soul  and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance  it is so 
long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day 
and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed 
for ever   that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been 
extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear 
can be hushed  never more to be heard  these are the reflections of 
the first days  but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the 
evil  then the actual bitterness of grief commences  yet from whom has 
not that rude hand rent away some dear connection  and why should i 
describe a sorrow which all have felt  and must feel  the time at 
length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity  and 
the smile that plays upon the lips  although it may be deemed a 
sacrilege  is not banished  my mother was dead  but we had still 
duties which we ought to perform  we must continue our course with the 
rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the 
spoiler has not seized  
 
my departure for ingolstadt  which had been deferred by these events  
was now again determined upon  i obtained from my father a respite of 
some weeks  it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose  
akin to death  of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of 
life  i was new to sorrow  but it did not the less alarm me  i was 
unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me  and above 
all  i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled  
 
she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all  
she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and 
zeal  she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call 
her uncle and cousins  never was she so enchanting as at this time  
when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us  
she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget  
 
the day of my departure at length arrived  clerval spent the last 
evening with us  he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit 
him to accompany me and to become my fellow student  but in vain  his 
father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the 
aspirations and ambition of his son  henry deeply felt the misfortune 
of being debarred from a liberal education  he said little  but when 
he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a 
restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details 
of commerce  
 
we sat late  we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor 
persuade ourselves to say the word    farewell     it was said  and we 
retired under the pretence of seeking repose  each fancying that the 
other was deceived  but when at morning   s dawn i descended to the 
carriage which was to convey me away  they were all there   my father 
again to bless me  clerval to press my hand once more  my elizabeth to 
renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last 
feminine attentions on her playmate and friend  
 
i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in 
the most melancholy reflections  i  who had ever been surrounded by 
amiable companions  continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual 
pleasure   i was now alone  in the university whither i was going i 
must form my own friends and be my own protector  my life had hitherto 
been remarkably secluded and domestic  and this had given me invincible 
repugnance to new countenances  i loved my brothers  elizabeth  and 
clerval  these were    old familiar faces     but i believed myself 
totally unfitted for the company of strangers  such were my reflections as 
i commenced my journey  but as i proceeded  my spirits and hopes rose  i 
ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge  i had often  when at home  
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had 
longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings   
now my desires were complied with  and it would  indeed  have been folly to 
repent  
 
i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my 
journey to ingolstadt  which was long and fatiguing  at length the 
high white steeple of the town met my eyes  i alighted and was 
conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased  
 
the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to 
some of the principal professors  chance   or rather the evil 
influence  the angel of destruction  which asserted omnipotent sway over me 
from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my father   s 
door   led me first to m  krempe  professor of natural philosophy  he 
was an uncouth man  but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science  he 
asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches 
of science appertaining to natural philosophy  i replied carelessly  and 
partly in contempt  mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal 
authors i had studied  the professor stared     have you     he 
said     really spent your time in studying such nonsense     
 
i replied in the affirmative     every minute     continued m  krempe with 
warmth     every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly 
and entirely lost  you have burdened your memory with exploded systems 
and useless names  good god  in what desert land have you lived  
where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you 
have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they 
are ancient  i little expected  in this enlightened and scientific 
age  to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus  my dear 
sir  you must begin your studies entirely anew     
 
so saying  he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books 
treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure  and 
dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following 
week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural 
philosophy in its general relations  and that m  waldman  a fellow 
professor  would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he 
omitted  
 
i returned home not disappointed  for i have said that i had long 
considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated  but i 
returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any 
shape  m  krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a 
repulsive countenance  the teacher  therefore  did not prepossess me in 
favour of his pursuits  in rather a too philosophical and connected a 
strain  perhaps  i have given an account of the conclusions i had come 
to concerning them in my early years  as a child i had not been 
content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural 
science  with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my 
extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters  i had retrod the 
steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the 
discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists  
besides  i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy  
it was very different when the masters of the science sought 
immortality and power  such views  although futile  were grand  but now 
the scene was changed  the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit 
itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in 
science was chiefly founded  i was required to exchange chimeras of 
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth  
 
such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my 
residence at ingolstadt  which were chiefly spent in becoming 
acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new 
abode  but as the ensuing week commenced  i thought of the information 
which m  krempe had given me concerning the lectures  and although i 
could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver 
sentences out of a pulpit  i recollected what he had said of m  
waldman  whom i had never seen  as he had hitherto been out of town  
 
partly from curiosity and partly from idleness  i went into the lecturing 
room  which m  waldman entered shortly after  this professor was very 
unlike his colleague  he appeared about fifty years of age  but with an 
aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence  a few grey hairs covered his 
temples  but those at the back of his head were nearly black  his person 
was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard  
he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and 
the various improvements made by different men of learning  pronouncing 
with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers  he then took 
a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of 
its elementary terms  after having made a few preparatory experiments  he 
concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry  the terms of which i 
shall never forget  
 
   the ancient teachers of this science     said he  
   promised impossibilities and performed nothing  the modern masters 
promise very little  they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that 
the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers  whose hands seem 
only made to dabble in dirt  and their eyes to pore over the microscope or 
crucible  have indeed performed miracles  they penetrate into the recesses 
of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places  they ascend into the 
heavens  they have discovered how the blood circulates  and the nature of 
the air we breathe  they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers  
they can command the thunders of heaven  mimic the earthquake  and even 
mock the invisible world with its own shadows     
 
such were the professor   s words   rather let me say such the words of 
the fate   enounced to destroy me  as he went on i felt as if my soul 
were grappling with a palpable enemy  one by one the various keys were 
touched which formed the mechanism of my being  chord after chord was 
sounded  and soon my mind was filled with one thought  one conception  
one purpose  so much has been done  exclaimed the soul of 
frankenstein   more  far more  will i achieve  treading in the steps 
already marked  i will pioneer a new way  explore unknown powers  and 
unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation  
 
i closed not my eyes that night  my internal being was in a state of 
insurrection and turmoil  i felt that order would thence arise  but i 
had no power to produce it  by degrees  after the morning   s dawn  
sleep came  i awoke  and my yesternight   s thoughts were as a dream  
there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to 
devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a 
natural talent  on the same day i paid m  waldman a visit  his 
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public  
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in 
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness  i 
gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had 
given to his fellow professor  he heard with attention the little 
narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius 
agrippa and paracelsus  but without the contempt that m  krempe had 
exhibited  he said that    these were men to whose indefatigable zeal 
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their 
knowledge  they had left to us  as an easier task  to give new names 
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a 
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light  the 
labours of men of genius  however erroneously directed  scarcely ever 
fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind     i 
listened to his statement  which was delivered without any presumption 
or affectation  and then added that his lecture had removed my 
prejudices against modern chemists  i expressed myself in measured 
terms  with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his 
instructor  without letting escape  inexperience in life would have 
made me ashamed  any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended 
labours  i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to 
procure  
 
   i am happy     said m  waldman     to have gained a 
disciple  and if your application equals your ability  i have no doubt of 
your success  chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the 
greatest improvements have been and may be made  it is on that account that 
i have made it my peculiar study  but at the same time  i have not 
neglected the other branches of science  a man would make but a very sorry 
chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone  if your 
wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty 
experimentalist  i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural 
philosophy  including mathematics     
 
he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his 
various machines  instructing me as to what i ought to procure and 
promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in 
the science not to derange their mechanism  he also gave me the list of 
books which i had requested  and i took my leave  
 
thus ended a day memorable to me  it decided my future destiny  
 
 
 
 
chapter 4 
 
 
from this day natural philosophy  and particularly chemistry  in the 
most comprehensive sense of the term  became nearly my sole occupation  
i read with ardour those works  so full of genius and discrimination  
which modern inquirers have written on these subjects  i attended the 
lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the 
university  and i found even in m  krempe a great deal of sound sense 
and real information  combined  it is true  with a repulsive 
physiognomy and manners  but not on that account the less valuable  in 
m  waldman i found a true friend  his gentleness was never tinged by 
dogmatism  and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and 
good nature that banished every idea of pedantry  in a thousand ways 
he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse 
inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension  my application was at 
first fluctuating and uncertain  it gained strength as i proceeded and 
soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the 
light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory  
 
as i applied so closely  it may be easily conceived that my progress 
was rapid  my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students  and 
my proficiency that of the masters  professor krempe often asked me  
with a sly smile  how cornelius agrippa went on  whilst m  waldman 
expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress  two years 
passed in this manner  during which i paid no visit to geneva  but was 
engaged  heart and soul  in the pursuit of some discoveries which i 
hoped to make  none but those who have experienced them can conceive 
of the enticements of science  in other studies you go as far as 
others have gone before you  and there is nothing more to know  but in 
a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder  
a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must 
infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study  and i  who 
continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was 
solely wrapped up in this  improved so rapidly that at the end of two 
years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical 
instruments  which procured me great esteem and admiration at the 
university  when i had arrived at this point and had become as well 
acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as 
depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt  my 
residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements  i thought 
of returning to my friends and my native town  when an incident 
happened that protracted my stay  
 
one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was 
the structure of the human frame  and  indeed  any animal endued with 
life  whence  i often asked myself  did the principle of life proceed  
it was a bold question  and one which has ever been considered as a 
mystery  yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming 
acquainted  if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our 
inquiries  i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined 
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of 
natural philosophy which relate to physiology  unless i had been 
animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm  my application to this 
study would have been irksome and almost intolerable  to examine the 
causes of life  we must first have recourse to death  i became 
acquainted with the science of anatomy  but this was not sufficient  i 
must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body  
in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my 
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors  i do not ever 
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared 
the apparition of a spirit  darkness had no effect upon my fancy  and 
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of 
life  which  from being the seat of beauty and strength  had become 
food for the worm  now i was led to examine the cause and progress of 
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and 
charnel-houses  my attention was fixed upon every object the most 
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings  i saw how the 
fine form of man was degraded and wasted  i beheld the corruption of 
death succeed to the blooming cheek of life  i saw how the worm 
inherited the wonders of the eye and brain  i paused  examining and 
analysing all the minutiae of causation  as exemplified in the change 
from life to death  and death to life  until from the midst of this 
darkness a sudden light broke in upon me   a light so brilliant and 
wondrous  yet so simple  that while i became dizzy with the immensity 
of the prospect which it illustrated  i was surprised that among so 
many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same 
science  that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a 
secret  
 
remember  i am not recording the vision of a madman  the sun does not 
more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is 
true  some miracle might have produced it  yet the stages of the 
discovery were distinct and probable  after days and nights of 
incredible labour and fatigue  i succeeded in discovering the cause of 
generation and life  nay  more  i became myself capable of bestowing 
animation upon lifeless matter  
 
the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery 
soon gave place to delight and rapture  after so much time spent in 
painful labour  to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the 
most gratifying consummation of my toils  but this discovery was so 
great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been 
progressively led to it were obliterated  and i beheld only the result  
what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation 
of the world was now within my grasp  not that  like a magic scene  it 
all opened upon me at once  the information i had obtained was of a 
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them 
towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already 
accomplished  i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead 
and found a passage to life  aided only by one glimmering and seemingly 
ineffectual light  
 
i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes 
express  my friend  that you expect to be informed of the secret with 
which i am acquainted  that cannot be  listen patiently until the end 
of my story  and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that 
subject  i will not lead you on  unguarded and ardent as i then was  
to your destruction and infallible misery  learn from me  if not by my 
precepts  at least by my example  how dangerous is the acquirement of 
knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town 
to be the world  than he who aspires to become greater than his nature 
will allow  
 
when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands  i hesitated 
a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it  
although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation  yet to 
prepare a frame for the reception of it  with all its intricacies of 
fibres  muscles  and veins  still remained a work of inconceivable 
difficulty and labour  i doubted at first whether i should attempt the 
creation of a being like myself  or one of simpler organization  but my 
imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to 
doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful 
as man  the materials at present within my command hardly appeared 
adequate to so arduous an undertaking  but i doubted not that i should 
ultimately succeed  i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses  my 
operations might be incessantly baffled  and at last my work be 
imperfect  yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes 
place in science and mechanics  i was encouraged to hope my present 
attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success  nor 
could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any 
argument of its impracticability  it was with these feelings that i 
began the creation of a human being  as the minuteness of the parts 
formed a great hindrance to my speed  i resolved  contrary to my first 
intention  to make the being of a gigantic stature  that is to say  
about eight feet in height  and proportionably large  after having 
formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully 
collecting and arranging my materials  i began  
 
no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards  like 
a hurricane  in the first enthusiasm of success  life and death 
appeared to me ideal bounds  which i should first break through  and 
pour a torrent of light into our dark world  a new species would bless 
me as its creator and source  many happy and excellent natures would 
owe their being to me  no father could claim the gratitude of his 
child so completely as i should deserve theirs  pursuing these 
reflections  i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless 
matter  i might in process of time  although i now found it impossible  
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption  
 
these thoughts supported my spirits  while i pursued my undertaking 
with unremitting ardour  my cheek had grown pale with study  and my 
person had become emaciated with confinement  sometimes  on the very 
brink of certainty  i failed  yet still i clung to the hope which the 
next day or the next hour might realise  one secret which i alone 
possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself  and the moon 
gazed on my midnight labours  while  with unrelaxed and breathless 
eagerness  i pursued nature to her hiding-places  who shall conceive 
the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps 
of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless 
clay  my limbs now tremble  and my eyes swim with the remembrance  but 
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward  i seemed 
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit  it was 
indeed but a passing trance  that only made me feel with renewed 
acuteness so soon as  the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate  i had 
returned to my old habits  i collected bones from charnel-houses and 
disturbed  with profane fingers  the tremendous secrets of the human 
frame  in a solitary chamber  or rather cell  at the top of the house  
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase  
i kept my workshop of filthy creation  my eyeballs were starting from 
their sockets in attending to the details of my employment  the 
dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials  
and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation  
whilst  still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased  i 
brought my work near to a conclusion  
 
the summer months passed while i was thus engaged  heart and soul  in 
one pursuit  it was a most beautiful season  never did the fields 
bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant 
vintage  but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature  and the 
same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also 
to forget those friends who were so many miles absent  and whom i had 
not seen for so long a time  i knew my silence disquieted them  and i 
well remembered the words of my father     i know that while you are 
pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection  and we shall 
hear regularly from you  you must pardon me if i regard any 
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties 
are equally neglected     
 
i knew well therefore what would be my father   s feelings  but i could 
not tear my thoughts from my employment  loathsome in itself  but which 
had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination  i wished  as it 
were  to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection 
until the great object  which swallowed up every habit of my nature  
should be completed  
 
i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect 
to vice or faultiness on my part  but i am now convinced that he was 
justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from 
blame  a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and 
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to 
disturb his tranquillity  i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge 
is an exception to this rule  if the study to which you apply yourself 
has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for 
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix  then that 
study is certainly unlawful  that is to say  not befitting the human 
mind  if this rule were always observed  if no man allowed any pursuit 
whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic 
affections  greece had not been enslaved  c  sar would have spared his 
country  america would have been discovered more gradually  and the 
empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed  
 
but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my 
tale  and your looks remind me to proceed  
 
my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my 
silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before  
winter  spring  and summer passed away during my labours  but i did not 
watch the blossom or the expanding leaves   sights which before always 
yielded me supreme delight   so deeply was i engrossed in my 
occupation  the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near 
to a close  and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had 
succeeded  but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety  and i appeared 
rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines  or any other 
unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment  
every night i was oppressed by a slow fever  and i became nervous to a most 
painful degree  the fall of a leaf startled me  and i shunned my fellow 
creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime  sometimes i grew alarmed at 
the wreck i perceived that i had become  the energy of my purpose alone 
sustained me  my labours would soon end  and i believed that exercise and 
amusement would then drive away incipient disease  and i promised myself 
both of these when my creation should be complete  
 
 
 
 
chapter 5 
 
 
it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment 
of my toils  with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony  i 
collected the instruments of life around me  that i might infuse a 
spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet  it was 
already one in the morning  the rain pattered dismally against the 
panes  and my candle was nearly burnt out  when  by the glimmer of the 
half-extinguished light  i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature 
open  it breathed hard  and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs  
 
how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe  or how delineate 
the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to 
form  his limbs were in proportion  and i had selected his features as 
beautiful  beautiful  great god  his yellow skin scarcely covered 
the work of muscles and arteries beneath  his hair was of a lustrous 
black  and flowing  his teeth of a pearly whiteness  but these 
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes  
that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which 
they were set  his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips  
 
the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings 
of human nature  i had worked hard for nearly two years  for the sole 
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body  for this i had 
deprived myself of rest and health  i had desired it with an ardour 
that far exceeded moderation  but now that i had finished  the beauty 
of the dream vanished  and breathless horror and disgust filled my 
heart  unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created  i 
rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my 
bed-chamber  unable to compose my mind to sleep  at length lassitude 
succeeded to the tumult i had before endured  and i threw myself on the 
bed in my clothes  endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness  
but it was in vain  i slept  indeed  but i was disturbed by the wildest 
dreams  i thought i saw elizabeth  in the bloom of health  walking in 
the streets of ingolstadt  delighted and surprised  i embraced her  
but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips  they became livid with 
the hue of death  her features appeared to change  and i thought that i 
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms  a shroud enveloped her 
form  and i saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel  
i started from my sleep with horror  a cold dew covered my forehead  my 
teeth chattered  and every limb became convulsed  when  by the dim and 
yellow light of the moon  as it forced its way through the window 
shutters  i beheld the wretch   the miserable monster whom i had 
created  he held up the curtain of the bed  and his eyes  if eyes they 
may be called  were fixed on me  his jaws opened  and he muttered some 
inarticulate sounds  while a grin wrinkled his cheeks  he might have 
spoken  but i did not hear  one hand was stretched out  seemingly to 
detain me  but i escaped and rushed downstairs  i took refuge in the 
courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited  where i remained 
during the rest of the night  walking up and down in the greatest 
agitation  listening attentively  catching and fearing each sound as if 
it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i 
had so miserably given life  
 
oh  no mortal could support the horror of that countenance  a mummy 
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch  i 
had gazed on him while unfinished  he was ugly then  but when those 
muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion  it became a thing 
such as even dante could not have conceived  
 
i passed the night wretchedly  sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and 
hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery  at others  i nearly 
sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness  mingled with 
this horror  i felt the bitterness of disappointment  dreams that had 
been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a 
hell to me  and the change was so rapid  the overthrow so complete  
 
morning  dismal and wet  at length dawned and discovered to my 
sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt  its white steeple 
and clock  which indicated the sixth hour  the porter opened the gates 
of the court  which had that night been my asylum  and i issued into 
the streets  pacing them with quick steps  as if i sought to avoid the 
wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my 
view  i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited  but 
felt impelled to hurry on  although drenched by the rain which poured 
from a black and comfortless sky  
 
i continued walking in this manner for some time  endeavouring by 
bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind  i 
traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or 
what i was doing  my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear  and i 
hurried on with irregular steps  not daring to look about me  
  
 like one who  on a lonely road  
 doth walk in fear and dread  
 and  having once turned round  walks on  
 and turns no more his head  
 because he knows a frightful fiend 
 doth close behind him tread  
  
  coleridge   s    ancient mariner      
 
 
 
continuing thus  i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various 
diligences and carriages usually stopped  here i paused  i knew not why  
but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming 
towards me from the other end of the street  as it drew nearer i observed 
that it was the swiss diligence  it stopped just where i was standing  and 
on the door being opened  i perceived henry clerval  who  on seeing me  
instantly sprung out     my dear frankenstein     exclaimed he  
   how glad i am to see you  how fortunate that you should be here at 
the very moment of my alighting     
 
nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval  his presence brought back 
to my thoughts my father  elizabeth  and all those scenes of home so dear 
to my recollection  i grasped his hand  and in a moment forgot my horror 
and misfortune  i felt suddenly  and for the first time during many months  
calm and serene joy  i welcomed my friend  therefore  in the most cordial 
manner  and we walked towards my college  clerval continued talking for 
some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being 
permitted to come to ingolstadt     you may easily believe     said 
he     how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all 
necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping  
and  indeed  i believe i left him incredulous to the last  for his constant 
answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch 
schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield     i have ten thousand florins 
a year without greek  i eat heartily without greek     but his 
affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning  and he has 
permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of 
knowledge     
 
   it gives me the greatest delight to see you  but tell me how you left 
my father  brothers  and elizabeth     
 
   very well  and very happy  only a little uneasy that they hear from 
you so seldom  by the by  i mean to lecture you a little upon their 
account myself  but  my dear frankenstein     continued he  stopping 
short and gazing full in my face     i did not before remark how very ill 
you appear  so thin and pale  you look as if you had been watching for 
several nights     
 
   you have guessed right  i have lately been so deeply engaged in one 
occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest  as you see  
but i hope  i sincerely hope  that all these employments are now at an 
end and that i am at length free     
 
i trembled excessively  i could not endure to think of  and far less to 
allude to  the occurrences of the preceding night  i walked with a 
quick pace  and we soon arrived at my college  i then reflected  and 
the thought made me shiver  that the creature whom i had left in my 
apartment might still be there  alive and walking about  i dreaded to 
behold this monster  but i feared still more that henry should see him  
entreating him  therefore  to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the 
stairs  i darted up towards my own room  my hand was already on the 
lock of the door before i recollected myself  i then paused  and a 
cold shivering came over me  i threw the door forcibly open  as 
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in 
waiting for them on the other side  but nothing appeared  i stepped 
fearfully in  the apartment was empty  and my bedroom was also freed 
from its hideous guest  i could hardly believe that so great a good 
fortune could have befallen me  but when i became assured that my enemy 
had indeed fled  i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval  
 
we ascended into my room  and the servant presently brought breakfast  
but i was unable to contain myself  it was not joy only that possessed 
me  i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness  and my pulse 
beat rapidly  i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same 
place  i jumped over the chairs  clapped my hands  and laughed aloud  
clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival  
but when he observed me more attentively  he saw a wildness in my eyes 
for which he could not account  and my loud  unrestrained  heartless 
laughter frightened and astonished him  
 
   my dear victor     cried he     what  for god   s sake  
is the matter  do not laugh in that manner  how ill you are  what is the 
cause of all this     
 
   do not ask me     cried i  putting my hands before my eyes  for i 
thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room      he  can 
tell  oh  save me  save me     i imagined that the monster seized me  
i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit  
 
poor clerval  what must have been his feelings  a meeting  which he 
anticipated with such joy  so strangely turned to bitterness  but i 
was not the witness of his grief  for i was lifeless and did not 
recover my senses for a long  long time  
 
this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for 
several months  during all that time henry was my only nurse  i 
afterwards learned that  knowing my father   s advanced age and unfitness 
for so long a journey  and how wretched my sickness would make 
elizabeth  he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my 
disorder  he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive 
nurse than himself  and  firm in the hope he felt of my recovery  he 
did not doubt that  instead of doing harm  he performed the kindest 
action that he could towards them  
 
but i was in reality very ill  and surely nothing but the unbounded and 
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life  
the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever 
before my eyes  and i raved incessantly concerning him  doubtless my 
words surprised henry  he at first believed them to be the wanderings 
of my disturbed imagination  but the pertinacity with which i 
continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder 
indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event  
 
by very slow degrees  and with frequent relapses that alarmed and 
grieved my friend  i recovered  i remember the first time i became 
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure  i 
perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young 
buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window  it was 
a divine spring  and the season contributed greatly to my 
convalescence  i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in 
my bosom  my gloom disappeared  and in a short time i became as 
cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion  
 
   dearest clerval     exclaimed i     how kind  how very good 
you are to me  this whole winter  instead of being spent in study  as you 
promised yourself  has been consumed in my sick room  how shall i ever 
repay you  i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i 
have been the occasion  but you will forgive me     
 
   you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself  but get 
well as fast as you can  and since you appear in such good spirits  i 
may speak to you on one subject  may i not     
 
i trembled  one subject  what could it be  could he allude to an object on 
whom i dared not even think  
 
   compose yourself     said clerval  who observed my change of 
colour     i will not mention it if it agitates you  but your father 
and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your 
own handwriting  they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at 
your long silence     
 
   is that all  my dear henry  how could you suppose that my first 
thought would not fly towards those dear  dear friends whom i love and 
who are so deserving of my love     
 
   if this is your present temper  my friend  you will perhaps be glad 
to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you  it is from 
your cousin  i believe     
 
 
 
 
chapter 6 
 
 
clerval then put the following letter into my hands  it was from my 
own elizabeth  
 
   my dearest cousin  
 
   you have been ill  very ill  and even the constant letters of dear 
kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account  you are 
forbidden to write   to hold a pen  yet one word from you  dear victor  
is necessary to calm our apprehensions  for a long time i have thought 
that each post would bring this line  and my persuasions have 
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt  i have 
prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so 
long a journey  yet how often have i regretted not being able to 
perform it myself  i figure to myself that the task of attending on 
your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse  who could never 
guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of 
your poor cousin  yet that is over now  clerval writes that indeed 
you are getting better  i eagerly hope that you will confirm this 
intelligence soon in your own handwriting  
 
   get well   and return to us  you will find a happy  cheerful home and 
friends who love you dearly  your father   s health is vigorous  and he 
asks but to see you  but to be assured that you are well  and not a 
care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance  how pleased you would 
be to remark the improvement of our ernest  he is now sixteen and full 
of activity and spirit  he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter 
into foreign service  but we cannot part with him  at least until his 
elder brother returns to us  my uncle is not pleased with the idea of 
a military career in a distant country  but ernest never had your 
powers of application  he looks upon study as an odious fetter  his 
time is spent in the open air  climbing the hills or rowing on the 
lake  i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point 
and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected  
 
   little alteration  except the growth of our dear children  has taken 
place since you left us  the blue lake and snow-clad mountains   they 
never change  and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are 
regulated by the same immutable laws  my trifling occupations take up 
my time and amuse me  and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing 
none but happy  kind faces around me  since you left us  but one 
change has taken place in our little household  do you remember on 
what occasion justine moritz entered our family  probably you do not  
i will relate her history  therefore in a few words  madame moritz  
her mother  was a widow with four children  of whom justine was the 
third  this girl had always been the favourite of her father  but 
through a strange perversity  her mother could not endure her  and 
after the death of m  moritz  treated her very ill  my aunt observed 
this  and when justine was twelve years of age  prevailed on her mother 
to allow her to live at our house  the republican institutions of our 
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which 
prevail in the great monarchies that surround it  hence there is less 
distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants  and the 
lower orders  being neither so poor nor so despised  their manners are 
more refined and moral  a servant in geneva does not mean the same 
thing as a servant in france and england  justine  thus received in 
our family  learned the duties of a servant  a condition which  in our 
fortunate country  does not include the idea of ignorance and a 
sacrifice of the dignity of a human being  
 
   justine  you may remember  was a great favourite of yours  and i 
recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour  one 
glance from justine could dissipate it  for the same reason that 
ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica   she looked so 
frank-hearted and happy  my aunt conceived a great attachment for her  
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that 
which she had at first intended  this benefit was fully repaid  
justine was the most grateful little creature in the world  i do not 
mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips  but 
you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress  
although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate  
yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt  she 
thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her 
phraseology and manners  so that even now she often reminds me of her  
 
   when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own 
grief to notice poor justine  who had attended her during her illness 
with the most anxious affection  poor justine was very ill  but other 
trials were reserved for her  
 
   one by one  her brothers and sister died  and her mother  with the 
exception of her neglected daughter  was left childless  the 
conscience of the woman was troubled  she began to think that the 
deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her 
partiality  she was a roman catholic  and i believe her confessor 
confirmed the idea which she had conceived  accordingly  a few months 
after your departure for ingolstadt  justine was called home by her 
repentant mother  poor girl  she wept when she quitted our house  she 
was much altered since the death of my aunt  grief had given softness 
and a winning mildness to her manners  which had before been remarkable 
for vivacity  nor was her residence at her mother   s house of a nature 
to restore her gaiety  the poor woman was very vacillating in her 
repentance  she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness  
but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her 
brothers and sister  perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz 
into a decline  which at first increased her irritability  but she is 
now at peace for ever  she died on the first approach of cold weather  
at the beginning of this last winter  justine has just returned to us  
and i assure you i love her tenderly  she is very clever and gentle  
and extremely pretty  as i mentioned before  her mien and her 
expression continually remind me of my dear aunt  
 
   i must say also a few words to you  my dear cousin  of little darling 
william  i wish you could see him  he is very tall of his age  with 
sweet laughing blue eyes  dark eyelashes  and curling hair  when he 
smiles  two little dimples appear on each cheek  which are rosy with 
health  he has already had one or two little  wives   but louisa biron 
is his favourite  a pretty little girl of five years of age  
 
   now  dear victor  i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little 
gossip concerning the good people of geneva  the pretty miss mansfield 
has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching 
marriage with a young englishman  john melbourne  esq  her ugly 
sister  manon  married m  duvillard  the rich banker  last autumn  your 
favourite schoolfellow  louis manoir  has suffered several misfortunes 
since the departure of clerval from geneva  but he has already 
recovered his spirits  and is reported to be on the point of marrying a 
lively pretty frenchwoman  madame tavernier  she is a widow  and much 
older than manoir  but she is very much admired  and a favourite with 
everybody  
 
   i have written myself into better spirits  dear cousin  but my anxiety 
returns upon me as i conclude  write  dearest victor    one line   one 
word will be a blessing to us  ten thousand thanks to henry for his 
kindness  his affection  and his many letters  we are sincerely 
grateful  adieu  my cousin  take care of yourself  and  i entreat 
you  write

   geneva  march 18th  17        
 
 
 
   dear  dear elizabeth     i exclaimed  when i had read her 
letter     i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety 
they must feel     i wrote  and this exertion greatly fatigued me  but 
my convalescence had commenced  and proceeded regularly  in another 
fortnight i was able to leave my chamber  
 
one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the 
several professors of the university  in doing this  i underwent a 
kind of rough usage  ill befitting the wounds that my mind had 
sustained  ever since the fatal night  the end of my labours  and the 
beginning of my misfortunes  i had conceived a violent antipathy even 
to the name of natural philosophy  when i was otherwise quite restored 
to health  the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony 
of my nervous symptoms  henry saw this  and had removed all my 
apparatus from my view  he had also changed my apartment  for he 
perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had 
previously been my laboratory  but these cares of clerval were made of 
no avail when i visited the professors  m  waldman inflicted torture 
when he praised  with kindness and warmth  the astonishing progress i 
had made in the sciences  he soon perceived that i disliked the 
subject  but not guessing the real cause  he attributed my feelings to 
modesty  and changed the subject from my improvement  to the science 
itself  with a desire  as i evidently saw  of drawing me out  what 
could i do  he meant to please  and he tormented me  i felt as if he 
had placed carefully  one by one  in my view those instruments which 
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death  i 
writhed under his words  yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt  
clerval  whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the 
sensations of others  declined the subject  alleging  in excuse  his 
total ignorance  and the conversation took a more general turn  i 
thanked my friend from my heart  but i did not speak  i saw plainly 
that he was surprised  but he never attempted to draw my secret from 
me  and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence 
that knew no bounds  yet i could never persuade myself to confide in 
him that event which was so often present to my recollection  but which 
i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply  
 
m  krempe was not equally docile  and in my condition at that time  of 
almost insupportable sensitiveness  his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even 
more pain than the benevolent approbation of m  waldman     d   n 
the fellow     cried he     why  m  clerval  i assure you he has 
outstript us all  ay  stare if you please  but it is nevertheless true  a 
youngster who  but a few years ago  believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly 
as in the gospel  has now set himself at the head of the university  and if 
he is not soon pulled down  we shall all be out of countenance    ay  
ay     continued he  observing my face expressive of suffering  
   m  frankenstein is modest  an excellent quality in a young man  
young men should be diffident of themselves  you know  m  clerval  i was 
myself when young  but that wears out in a very short time     
 
m  krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself  which happily turned 
the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me  
 
clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science  and his 
literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me  he 
came to the university with the design of making himself complete 
master of the oriental languages  and thus he should open a field for 
the plan of life he had marked out for himself  resolved to pursue no 
inglorious career  he turned his eyes toward the east  as affording 
scope for his spirit of enterprise  the persian  arabic  and sanskrit 
languages engaged his attention  and i was easily induced to enter on 
the same studies  idleness had ever been irksome to me  and now that i 
wished to fly from reflection  and hated my former studies  i felt 
great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend  and found not 
only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists  i 
did not  like him  attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects  for 
i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary 
amusement  i read merely to understand their meaning  and they well 
repaid my labours  their melancholy is soothing  and their joy 
elevating  to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of 
any other country  when you read their writings  life appears to 
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses    in the smiles and frowns 
of a fair enemy  and the fire that consumes your own heart  how 
different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome  
 
summer passed away in these occupations  and my return to geneva was 
fixed for the latter end of autumn  but being delayed by several 
accidents  winter and snow arrived  the roads were deemed impassable  
and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring  i felt this 
delay very bitterly  for i longed to see my native town and my beloved 
friends  my return had only been delayed so long  from an 
unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place  before he had become 
acquainted with any of its inhabitants  the winter  however  was spent 
cheerfully  and although the spring was uncommonly late  when it came 
its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness  
 
the month of may had already commenced  and i expected the letter daily 
which was to fix the date of my departure  when henry proposed a 
pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt  that i might bid a 
personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited  i acceded 
with pleasure to this proposition  i was fond of exercise  and clerval 
had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature 
that i had taken among the scenes of my native country  
 
we passed a fortnight in these perambulations  my health and spirits 
had long been restored  and they gained additional strength from the 
salubrious air i breathed  the natural incidents of our progress  and 
the conversation of my friend  study had before secluded me from the 
intercourse of my fellow-creatures  and rendered me unsocial  but 
clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart  he again taught 
me to love the aspect of nature  and the cheerful faces of children  
excellent friend  how sincerely you did love me  and endeavour to 
elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own  a selfish 
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me  until your gentleness and 
affection warmed and opened my senses  i became the same happy creature 
who  a few years ago  loved and beloved by all  had no sorrow or care  
when happy  inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most 
delightful sensations  a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with 
ecstasy  the present season was indeed divine  the flowers of spring 
bloomed in the hedges  while those of summer were already in bud  i 
was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed 
upon me  notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off  with an 
invincible burden  
 
henry rejoiced in my gaiety  and sincerely sympathised in my feelings  he 
exerted himself to amuse me  while he expressed the sensations that filled 
his soul  the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly 
astonishing  his conversation was full of imagination  and very often  in 
imitation of the persian and arabic writers  he invented tales of wonderful 
fancy and passion  at other times he repeated my favourite poems  or drew 
me out into arguments  which he supported with great ingenuity  
 
we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon  the peasants were 
dancing  and every one we met appeared gay and happy  my own spirits were 
high  and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity  
 
 
 
 
chapter 7 
 
 
on my return  i found the following letter from my father     
 
   my dear victor  
 
   you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of 
your return to us  and i was at first tempted to write only a few 
lines  merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you  but 
that would be a cruel kindness  and i dare not do it  what would be 
your surprise  my son  when you expected a happy and glad welcome  to 
behold  on the contrary  tears and wretchedness  and how  victor  can 
i relate our misfortune  absence cannot have rendered you callous to 
our joys and griefs  and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent 
son  i wish to prepare you for the woeful news  but i know it is 
impossible  even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words 
which are to convey to you the horrible tidings  
 
   william is dead    that sweet child  whose smiles delighted and warmed 
my heart  who was so gentle  yet so gay  victor  he is murdered  
 
   i will not attempt to console you  but will simply relate the 
circumstances of the transaction  
 
   last thursday  may 7th   i  my niece  and your two brothers  went to 
walk in plainpalais  the evening was warm and serene  and we prolonged 
our walk farther than usual  it was already dusk before we thought of 
returning  and then we discovered that william and ernest  who had gone 
on before  were not to be found  we accordingly rested on a seat until 
they should return  presently ernest came  and enquired if we had seen 
his brother  he said  that he had been playing with him  that william 
had run away to hide himself  and that he vainly sought for him  and 
afterwards waited for a long time  but that he did not return  
 
   this account rather alarmed us  and we continued to search for him 
until night fell  when elizabeth conjectured that he might have 
returned to the house  he was not there  we returned again  with 
torches  for i could not rest  when i thought that my sweet boy had 
lost himself  and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night  
elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish  about five in the morning i 
discovered my lovely boy  whom the night before i had seen blooming and 
active in health  stretched on the grass livid and motionless  the 
print of the murder   s finger was on his neck  
 
   he was conveyed home  and the anguish that was visible in my 
countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth  she was very earnest to 
see the corpse  at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted  
and entering the room where it lay  hastily examined the neck of the 
victim  and clasping her hands exclaimed     o god  i have murdered my 
darling child     
 
   she fainted  and was restored with extreme difficulty  when she again 
lived  it was only to weep and sigh  she told me  that that same 
evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable 
miniature that she possessed of your mother  this picture is gone  and 
was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed  we 
have no trace of him at present  although our exertions to discover him 
are unremitted  but they will not restore my beloved william  
 
   come  dearest victor  you alone can console elizabeth  she weeps 
continually  and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death  
her words pierce my heart  we are all unhappy  but will not that be an 
additional motive for you  my son  to return and be our comforter  
your dear mother  alas  victor  i now say  thank god she did not live 
to witness the cruel  miserable death of her youngest darling  
 
   come  victor  not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin  
but with feelings of peace and gentleness  that will heal  instead of 
festering  the wounds of our minds  enter the house of mourning  my 
friend  but with kindness and affection for those who love you  and not 
with hatred for your enemies  
 
   your affectionate and afflicted father  
 
   alphonse frankenstein  
 
 
 
   geneva  may 12th  17        
 
 
 
clerval  who had watched my countenance as i read this letter  was 
surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first 
expressed on receiving new from my friends  i threw the letter on the 
table  and covered my face with my hands  
 
   my dear frankenstein     exclaimed henry  when he perceived me 
weep with bitterness     are you always to be unhappy  my dear friend  
what has happened     
 
i motioned him to take up the letter  while i walked up and down the 
room in the extremest agitation  tears also gushed from the eyes of 
clerval  as he read the account of my misfortune  
 
   i can offer you no consolation  my friend     said he  
   your disaster is irreparable  what do you intend to do     
 
   to go instantly to geneva  come with me  henry  to order the horses     
 
during our walk  clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation  
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy     poor william     said he  
   dear lovely child  he now sleeps with his angel mother  who that had 
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty  but must weep over his 
untimely loss  to die so miserably  to feel the murderer   s grasp  how 
much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence  poor little 
fellow  one only consolation have we  his friends mourn and weep  but 
he is at rest  the pang is over  his sufferings are at an end for ever  
a sod covers his gentle form  and he knows no pain  he can no longer 
be a subject for pity  we must reserve that for his miserable 
survivors     
 
clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets  the words 
impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in 
solitude  but now  as soon as the horses arrived  i hurried into a 
cabriolet  and bade farewell to my friend  
 
my journey was very melancholy  at first i wished to hurry on  for i longed 
to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends  but when i 
drew near my native town  i slackened my progress  i could hardly sustain 
the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind  i passed through 
scenes familiar to my youth  but which i had not seen for nearly six years  
how altered every thing might be during that time  one sudden and 
desolating change had taken place  but a thousand little circumstances 
might have by degrees worked other alterations  which  although they were 
done more tranquilly  might not be the less decisive  fear overcame me  i 
dared no advance  dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble  
although i was unable to define them  
 
i remained two days at lausanne  in this painful state of mind  i 
contemplated the lake  the waters were placid  all around was calm  and the 
snowy mountains     the palaces of nature     were not changed  by 
degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me  and i continued my journey 
towards geneva  
 
the road ran by the side of the lake  which became narrower as i 
approached my native town  i discovered more distinctly the black 
sides of jura  and the bright summit of mont blanc  i wept like a 
child     dear mountains  my own beautiful lake  how do you welcome your 
wanderer  your summits are clear  the sky and lake are blue and 
placid  is this to prognosticate peace  or to mock at my unhappiness     
 
i fear  my friend  that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on 
these preliminary circumstances  but they were days of comparative 
happiness  and i think of them with pleasure  my country  my beloved 
country  who but a native can tell the delight i took in again 
beholding thy streams  thy mountains  and  more than all  thy lovely 
lake  
 
yet  as i drew nearer home  grief and fear again overcame me  night also 
closed around  and when i could hardly see the dark mountains  i felt still 
more gloomily  the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil  and i 
foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human 
beings  alas  i prophesied truly  and failed only in one single 
circumstance  that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded  i did not 
conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure  
 
it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva  the gates 
of the town were already shut  and i was obliged to pass the night at 
secheron  a village at the distance of half a league from the city  the sky 
was serene  and  as i was unable to rest  i resolved to visit the spot 
where my poor william had been murdered  as i could not pass through the 
town  i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais  
during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont 
blanc in the most beautiful figures  the storm appeared to approach 
rapidly  and  on landing  i ascended a low hill  that i might observe its 
progress  it advanced  the heavens were clouded  and i soon felt the rain 
coming slowly in large drops  but its violence quickly increased  
 
i quitted my seat  and walked on  although the darkness and storm 
increased every minute  and the thunder burst with a terrific crash 
over my head  it was echoed from sal  ve  the juras  and the alps of 
savoy  vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes  illuminating the 
lake  making it appear like a vast sheet of fire  then for an instant 
every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness  until the eye recovered itself 
from the preceding flash  the storm  as is often the case in 
switzerland  appeared at once in various parts of the heavens  the 
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town  over the part of the 
lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of 
cop  t  another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes  and another 
darkened and sometimes disclosed the m  le  a peaked mountain to the 
east of the lake  
 
while i watched the tempest  so beautiful yet terrific  i wandered on with 
a hasty step  this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits  i clasped my 
hands  and exclaimed aloud     william  dear angel  this is thy 
funeral  this thy dirge     as i said these words  i perceived in the 
gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me  i stood 
fixed  gazing intently  i could not be mistaken  a flash of lightning 
illuminated the object  and discovered its shape plainly to me  its 
gigantic stature  and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs 
to humanity  instantly informed me that it was the wretch  the filthy 
d  mon  to whom i had given life  what did he there  could he be  i 
shuddered at the conception  the murderer of my brother  no sooner did that 
idea cross my imagination  than i became convinced of its truth  my teeth 
chattered  and i was forced to lean against a tree for support  the figure 
passed me quickly  and i lost it in the gloom  nothing in human shape could 
have destroyed the fair child   he  was the murderer  i could not 
doubt it  the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the 
fact  i thought of pursuing the devil  but it would have been in vain  for 
another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly 
perpendicular ascent of mont sal  ve  a hill that bounds plainpalais on the 
south  he soon reached the summit  and disappeared  
 
i remained motionless  the thunder ceased  but the rain still 
continued  and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness  i 
revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget  
the whole train of my progress toward the creation  the appearance of 
the works of my own hands at my bedside  its departure  two years had 
now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life  and 
was this his first crime  alas  i had turned loose into the world a 
depraved wretch  whose delight was in carnage and misery  had he not 
murdered my brother  
 
no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the 
night  which i spent  cold and wet  in the open air  but i did not 
feel the inconvenience of the weather  my imagination was busy in 
scenes of evil and despair  i considered the being whom i had cast 
among mankind  and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes 
of horror  such as the deed which he had now done  nearly in the light 
of my own vampire  my own spirit let loose from the grave  and forced 
to destroy all that was dear to me  
 
day dawned  and i directed my steps towards the town  the gates were 
open  and i hastened to my father   s house  my first thought was to 
discover what i knew of the murderer  and cause instant pursuit to be 
made  but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell  a 
being whom i myself had formed  and endued with life  had met me at 
midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain  i 
remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at 
the time that i dated my creation  and which would give an air of 
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable  i well knew that 
if any other had communicated such a relation to me  i should have 
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity  besides  the strange nature 
of the animal would elude all pursuit  even if i were so far credited 
as to persuade my relatives to commence it  and then of what use would 
be pursuit  who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the 
overhanging sides of mont sal  ve  these reflections determined me  and 
i resolved to remain silent  
 
it was about five in the morning when i entered my father   s house  i 
told the servants not to disturb the family  and went into the library 
to attend their usual hour of rising  
 
six years had elapsed  passed in a dream but for one indelible trace  and i 
stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my 
departure for ingolstadt  beloved and venerable parent  he still remained 
to me  i gazed on the picture of my mother  which stood over the 
mantel-piece  it was an historical subject  painted at my father   s 
desire  and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair  kneeling 
by the coffin of her dead father  her garb was rustic  and her cheek pale  
but there was an air of dignity and beauty  that hardly permitted the 
sentiment of pity  below this picture was a miniature of william  and my 
tears flowed when i looked upon it  while i was thus engaged  ernest 
entered  he had heard me arrive  and hastened to welcome me  
   welcome  my dearest victor     said he     ah  i wish you 
had come three months ago  and then you would have found us all joyous and 
delighted  you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can 
alleviate  yet your presence will  i hope  revive our father  who seems 
sinking under his misfortune  and your persuasions will induce poor 
elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations    poor 
william  he was our darling and our pride     
 
tears  unrestrained  fell from my brother   s eyes  a sense of mortal 
agony crept over my frame  before  i had only imagined the 
wretchedness of my desolated home  the reality came on me as a new  and 
a not less terrible  disaster  i tried to calm ernest  i enquired more 
minutely concerning my father  and here i named my cousin  
 
   she most of all     said ernest     requires consolation  she accused 
herself of having caused the death of my brother  and that made her 
very wretched  but since the murderer has been discovered       
 
   the murderer discovered  good god  how can that be  who could attempt 
to pursue him  it is impossible  one might as well try to overtake the 
winds  or confine a mountain-stream with a straw  i saw him too  he 
was free last night     
 
   i do not know what you mean     replied my brother  in accents of 
wonder     but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery  no 
one would believe it at first  and even now elizabeth will not be 
convinced  notwithstanding all the evidence  indeed  who would credit 
that justine moritz  who was so amiable  and fond of all the family  
could suddenly become so capable of so frightful  so appalling a crime     
 
   justine moritz  poor  poor girl  is she the accused  but it is 
wrongfully  every one knows that  no one believes it  surely  ernest     
 
   no one did at first  but several circumstances came out  that have 
almost forced conviction upon us  and her own behaviour has been so 
confused  as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that  i fear  
leaves no hope for doubt  but she will be tried today  and you will 
then hear all     
 
he then related that  the morning on which the murder of poor william 
had been discovered  justine had been taken ill  and confined to her 
bed for several days  during this interval  one of the servants  
happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the 
murder  had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother  which 
had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer  the servant 
instantly showed it to one of the others  who  without saying a word to 
any of the family  went to a magistrate  and  upon their deposition  
justine was apprehended  on being charged with the fact  the poor girl 
confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of 
manner  
 
this was a strange tale  but it did not shake my faith  and i replied 
earnestly     you are all mistaken  i know the murderer  justine  poor  
good justine  is innocent     
 
at that instant my father entered  i saw unhappiness deeply impressed 
on his countenance  but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully  and  
after we had exchanged our mournful greeting  would have introduced 
some other topic than that of our disaster  had not ernest exclaimed  
   good god  papa  victor says that he knows who was the murderer of 
poor william     
 
   we do also  unfortunately     replied my father     for indeed i had 
rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much 
depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly     
 
   my dear father  you are mistaken  justine is innocent     
 
   if she is  god forbid that she should suffer as guilty  she is to be 
tried today  and i hope  i sincerely hope  that she will be acquitted     
 
this speech calmed me  i was firmly convinced in my own mind that 
justine  and indeed every human being  was guiltless of this murder  i 
had no fear  therefore  that any circumstantial evidence could be 
brought forward strong enough to convict her  my tale was not one to 
announce publicly  its astounding horror would be looked upon as 
madness by the vulgar  did any one indeed exist  except i  the 
creator  who would believe  unless his senses convinced him  in the 
existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance 
which i had let loose upon the world  
 
we were soon joined by elizabeth  time had altered her since i last 
beheld her  it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of 
her childish years  there was the same candour  the same vivacity  but 
it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect  
she welcomed me with the greatest affection     your arrival  my dear 
cousin     said she     fills me with hope  you perhaps will find some 
means to justify my poor guiltless justine  alas  who is safe  if she 
be convicted of crime  i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do 
upon my own  our misfortune is doubly hard to us  we have not only 
lost that lovely darling boy  but this poor girl  whom i sincerely 
love  is to be torn away by even a worse fate  if she is condemned  i 
never shall know joy more  but she will not  i am sure she will not  
and then i shall be happy again  even after the sad death of my little 
william     
 
   she is innocent  my elizabeth     said i     and that shall 
be proved  fear nothing  but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance 
of her acquittal     
 
   how kind and generous you are  every one else believes in her guilt  
and that made me wretched  for i knew that it was impossible  and to 
see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me 
hopeless and despairing     she wept  
 
   dearest niece     said my father     dry your tears  if she 
is  as you believe  innocent  rely on the justice of our laws  and the 
activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of 
partiality     
 
 
 
 
chapter 8 
 
 
we passed a few sad hours until eleven o   clock  when the trial was to 
commence  my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend 
as witnesses  i accompanied them to the court  during the whole of 
this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture  it was to 
be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would 
cause the death of two of my fellow beings  one a smiling babe full of 
innocence and joy  the other far more dreadfully murdered  with every 
aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror  
justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised 
to render her life happy  now all was to be obliterated in an 
ignominious grave  and i the cause  a thousand times rather would i 
have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine  but i 
was absent when it was committed  and such a declaration would have 
been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have 
exculpated her who suffered through me  
 
the appearance of justine was calm  she was dressed in mourning  and 
her countenance  always engaging  was rendered  by the solemnity of her 
feelings  exquisitely beautiful  yet she appeared confident in 
innocence and did not tremble  although gazed on and execrated by 
thousands  for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have 
excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the 
imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed  she 
was tranquil  yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained  and as 
her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt  she 
worked up her mind to an appearance of courage  when she entered the 
court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were 
seated  a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us  but she quickly 
recovered herself  and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest 
her utter guiltlessness  
 
the trial began  and after the advocate against her had stated the 
charge  several witnesses were called  several strange facts combined 
against her  which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof 
of her innocence as i had  she had been out the whole of the night on 
which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been 
perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the 
murdered child had been afterwards found  the woman asked her what she 
did there  but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused 
and unintelligible answer  she returned to the house about eight 
o   clock  and when one inquired where she had passed the night  she 
replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly 
if anything had been heard concerning him  when shown the body  she 
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days  the 
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket  
and when elizabeth  in a faltering voice  proved that it was the same 
which  an hour before the child had been missed  she had placed round 
his neck  a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court  
 
justine was called on for her defence  as the trial had proceeded  her 
countenance had altered  surprise  horror  and misery were strongly 
expressed  sometimes she struggled with her tears  but when she was 
desired to plead  she collected her powers and spoke in an audible 
although variable voice  
 
   god knows     she said     how entirely i am innocent  but i 
do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me  i rest my innocence 
on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced 
against me  and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my 
judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears 
doubtful or suspicious     
 
she then related that  by the permission of elizabeth  she had passed 
the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the 
house of an aunt at ch  ne  a village situated at about a league from 
geneva  on her return  at about nine o   clock  she met a man who asked 
her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost  she was 
alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him  
when the gates of geneva were shut  and she was forced to remain 
several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage  being 
unwilling to call up the inhabitants  to whom she was well known  most 
of the night she spent here watching  towards morning she believed that 
she slept for a few minutes  some steps disturbed her  and she awoke  
it was dawn  and she quitted her asylum  that she might again endeavour 
to find my brother  if she had gone near the spot where his body lay  
it was without her knowledge  that she had been bewildered when 
questioned by the market-woman was not surprising  since she had passed 
a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain  
concerning the picture she could give no account  
 
   i know     continued the unhappy victim     how heavily and 
fatally this one circumstance weighs against me  but i have no power of 
explaining it  and when i have expressed my utter ignorance  i am only left 
to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been 
placed in my pocket  but here also i am checked  i believe that i have no 
enemy on earth  and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me 
wantonly  did the murderer place it there  i know of no opportunity 
afforded him for so doing  or  if i had  why should he have stolen the 
jewel  to part with it again so soon  
 
   i commit my cause to the justice of my judges  yet i see no room for 
hope  i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my 
character  and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed 
guilt  i must be condemned  although i would pledge my salvation on my 
innocence     
 
several witnesses were called who had known her for many years  and 
they spoke well of her  but fear and hatred of the crime of which they 
supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come 
forward  elizabeth saw even this last resource  her excellent 
dispositions and irreproachable conduct  about to fail the accused  
when  although violently agitated  she desired permission to address 
the court  
 
   i am     said she     the cousin of the unhappy child who 
was murdered  or rather his sister  for i was educated by and have lived 
with his parents ever since and even long before his birth  it may 
therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion  but 
when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her 
pretended friends  i wish to be allowed to speak  that i may say what i 
know of her character  i am well acquainted with the accused  i have lived 
in the same house with her  at one time for five and at another for nearly 
two years  during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and 
benevolent of human creatures  she nursed madame frankenstein  my aunt  in 
her last illness  with the greatest affection and care and afterwards 
attended her own mother during a tedious illness  in a manner that excited 
the admiration of all who knew her  after which she again lived in my 
uncle   s house  where she was beloved by all the family  she was 
warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a 
most affectionate mother  for my own part  i do not hesitate to say that  
notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her  i believe and rely 
on her perfect innocence  she had no temptation for such an action  as to 
the bauble on which the chief proof rests  if she had earnestly desired it  
i should have willingly given it to her  so much do i esteem and value 
her     
 
a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth   s simple and powerful 
appeal  but it was excited by her generous interference  and not in 
favour of poor justine  on whom the public indignation was turned with 
renewed violence  charging her with the blackest ingratitude  she 
herself wept as elizabeth spoke  but she did not answer  my own 
agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial  i believed 
in her innocence  i knew it  could the d  mon who had  i did not for a 
minute doubt  murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have 
betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy  i could not sustain the 
horror of my situation  and when i perceived that the popular voice and 
the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim  
i rushed out of the court in agony  the tortures of the accused did 
not equal mine  she was sustained by innocence  but the fangs of 
remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold  
 
i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness  in the morning i went to 
the court  my lips and throat were parched  i dared not ask the fatal 
question  but i was known  and the officer guessed the cause of my 
visit  the ballots had been thrown  they were all black  and justine 
was condemned  
 
i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt  i had before 
experienced sensations of horror  and i have endeavoured to bestow upon 
them adequate expressions  but words cannot convey an idea of the 
heart-sickening despair that i then endured  the person to whom i 
addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt  
   that evidence     he observed     was hardly required in so glaring a 
case  but i am glad of it  and  indeed  none of our judges like to 
condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence  be it ever so 
decisive     
 
this was strange and unexpected intelligence  what could it mean  had 
my eyes deceived me  and was i really as mad as the whole world would 
believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions  i 
hastened to return home  and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result  
 
   my cousin     replied i     it is decided as you may have expected  all 
judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty 
should escape  but she has confessed     
 
this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth  who had relied with firmness upon 
justine   s innocence     alas     said she     how shall i 
ever again believe in human goodness  justine  whom i loved and esteemed as 
my sister  how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray  
her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile  and yet she has 
committed a murder     
 
soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my 
cousin  my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own 
judgment and feelings to decide     yes     said elizabeth  
   i will go  although she is guilty  and you  victor  shall accompany 
me  i cannot go alone     the idea of this visit was torture to me  yet 
i could not refuse  
 
we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some 
straw at the farther end  her hands were manacled  and her head rested on 
her knees  she rose on seeing us enter  and when we were left alone with 
her  she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth  weeping bitterly  my 
cousin wept also  
 
   oh  justine     said she     why did you rob me of my last consolation  
i relied on your innocence  and although i was then very wretched  i 
was not so miserable as i am now     
 
   and do you also believe that i am so very  very wicked  do you also 
join with my enemies to crush me  to condemn me as a murderer     her 
voice was suffocated with sobs  
 
   rise  my poor girl     said elizabeth     why do you kneel  
if you are innocent  i am not one of your enemies  i believed you 
guiltless  notwithstanding every evidence  until i heard that you had 
yourself declared your guilt  that report  you say  is false  and be 
assured  dear justine  that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a 
moment  but your own confession     
 
   i did confess  but i confessed a lie  i confessed  that i might 
obtain absolution  but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than 
all my other sins  the god of heaven forgive me  ever since i was 
condemned  my confessor has besieged me  he threatened and menaced  
until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i 
was  he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if 
i continued obdurate  dear lady  i had none to support me  all looked 
on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition  what could i do  
in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie  and now only am i truly 
miserable     
 
she paused  weeping  and then continued     i thought with horror  my 
sweet lady  that you should believe your justine  whom your blessed 
aunt had so highly honoured  and whom you loved  was a creature capable 
of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated  
dear william  dearest blessed child  i soon shall see you again in 
heaven  where we shall all be happy  and that consoles me  going as i 
am to suffer ignominy and death     
 
   oh  justine  forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you  
why did you confess  but do not mourn  dear girl  do not fear  i 
will proclaim  i will prove your innocence  i will melt the stony 
hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers  you shall not die  
you  my playfellow  my companion  my sister  perish on the scaffold  
no  no  i never could survive so horrible a misfortune     
 
justine shook her head mournfully     i do not fear to die     she said  
   that pang is past  god raises my weakness and gives me courage to 
endure the worst  i leave a sad and bitter world  and if you remember 
me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned  i am resigned to the 
fate awaiting me  learn from me  dear lady  to submit in patience to 
the will of heaven     
 
during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room  
where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me  despair  
who dared talk of that  the poor victim  who on the morrow was to pass 
the awful boundary between life and death  felt not  as i did  such 
deep and bitter agony  i gnashed my teeth and ground them together  
uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul  justine started  when 
she saw who it was  she approached me and said     dear sir  you are very 
kind to visit me  you  i hope  do not believe that i am guilty     
 
i could not answer     no  justine     said elizabeth     he is more 
convinced of your innocence than i was  for even when he heard that you 
had confessed  he did not credit it     
 
   i truly thank him  in these last moments i feel the sincerest 
gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness  how sweet is 
the affection of others to such a wretch as i am  it removes more than 
half my misfortune  and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my 
innocence is acknowledged by you  dear lady  and your cousin     
 
thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself  she indeed 
gained the resignation she desired  but i  the true murderer  felt the 
never-dying worm alive in my bosom  which allowed of no hope or 
consolation  elizabeth also wept and was unhappy  but hers also was 
the misery of innocence  which  like a cloud that passes over the fair 
moon  for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness  anguish and 
despair had penetrated into the core of my heart  i bore a hell within 
me which nothing could extinguish  we stayed several hours with 
justine  and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear 
herself away     i wish     cried she     that i were to die with you  i 
cannot live in this world of misery     
 
justine assumed an air of cheerfulness  while she with difficulty 
repressed her bitter tears  she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice 
of half-suppressed emotion     farewell  sweet lady  dearest elizabeth  
my beloved and only friend  may heaven  in its bounty  bless and 
preserve you  may this be the last misfortune that you will ever 
suffer  live  and be happy  and make others so     
 
and on the morrow justine died  elizabeth   s heart-rending eloquence 
failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the 
criminality of the saintly sufferer  my passionate and indignant 
appeals were lost upon them  and when i received their cold answers 
and heard the harsh  unfeeling reasoning of these men  my purposed 
avowal died away on my lips  thus i might proclaim myself a madman  
but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim  she 
perished on the scaffold as a murderess  
 
from the tortures of my own heart  i turned to contemplate the deep and 
voiceless grief of my elizabeth  this also was my doing  and my 
father   s woe  and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was 
the work of my thrice-accursed hands  ye weep  unhappy ones  but these 
are not your last tears  again shall you raise the funeral wail  and 
the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard  
frankenstein  your son  your kinsman  your early  much-loved friend  he 
who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes  who has no 
thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear 
countenances  who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life 
in serving you   he bids you weep  to shed countless tears  happy beyond 
his hopes  if thus inexorable fate be satisfied  and if the destruction 
pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments  
 
thus spoke my prophetic soul  as  torn by remorse  horror  and despair  
i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and 
justine  the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts  
 
 
 
 
chapter 9 
 
 
nothing is more painful to the human mind than  after the feelings have 
been worked up by a quick succession of events  the dead calmness of 
inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope 
and fear  justine died  she rested  and i was alive  the blood flowed 
freely in my veins  but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my 
heart which nothing could remove  sleep fled from my eyes  i wandered 
like an evil spirit  for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond 
description horrible  and more  much more  i persuaded myself  was yet 
behind  yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue  
i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment 
when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow 
beings  now all was blasted  instead of that serenity of conscience 
which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction  and 
from thence to gather promise of new hopes  i was seized by remorse and 
the sense of guilt  which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures 
such as no language can describe  
 
this state of mind preyed upon my health  which had perhaps never 
entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained  i shunned 
the face of man  all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me  
solitude was my only consolation   deep  dark  deathlike solitude  
 
my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition 
and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his 
serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and 
awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me  
   do you think  victor     said he     that i do not suffer 
also  no one could love a child more than i loved your 
brother      tears came into his eyes as he spoke      but 
is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting 
their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief  it is also a duty 
owed to yourself  for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment  
or even the discharge of daily usefulness  without which no man is fit for 
society     
 
this advice  although good  was totally inapplicable to my case  i 
should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if 
remorse had not mingled its bitterness  and terror its alarm  with my 
other sensations  now i could only answer my father with a look of 
despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view  
 
about this time we retired to our house at belrive  this change was 
particularly agreeable to me  the shutting of the gates regularly at 
ten o   clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that 
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome 
to me  i was now free  often  after the rest of the family had 
retired for the night  i took the boat and passed many hours upon the 
water  sometimes  with my sails set  i was carried by the wind  and 
sometimes  after rowing into the middle of the lake  i left the boat to 
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections  i 
was often tempted  when all was at peace around me  and i the only 
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and 
heavenly   if i except some bat  or the frogs  whose harsh and 
interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore   often  
i say  i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake  that the waters 
might close over me and my calamities for ever  but i was restrained  
when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth  whom i tenderly 
loved  and whose existence was bound up in mine  i thought also of my 
father and surviving brother  should i by my base desertion leave them 
exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose 
among them  
 
at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my 
mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness  but that 
could not be  remorse extinguished every hope  i had been the author of 
unalterable evils  and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had 
created should perpetrate some new wickedness  i had an obscure feeling 
that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime  
which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past  
there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained 
behind  my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived  when i thought of 
him i gnashed my teeth  my eyes became inflamed  and i ardently wished to 
extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed  when i 
reflected on his crimes and malice  my hatred and revenge burst all bounds 
of moderation  i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the 
andes  could i  when there  have precipitated him to their base  i wished 
to see him again  that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his 
head and avenge the deaths of william and justine  
 
our house was the house of mourning  my father   s health was deeply 
shaken by the horror of the recent events  elizabeth was sad and 
desponding  she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations  all 
pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead  eternal woe and tears she 
then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted 
and destroyed  she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth 
wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our 
future prospects  the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from 
the earth had visited her  and its dimming influence quenched her dearest 
smiles  
 
   when i reflect  my dear cousin     said she     on the miserable death of 
justine moritz  i no longer see the world and its works as they before 
appeared to me  before  i looked upon the accounts of vice and 
injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient 
days or imaginary evils  at least they were remote and more familiar to 
reason than to the imagination  but now misery has come home  and men 
appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other   s blood  yet i am 
certainly unjust  everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty  and 
if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered  assuredly 
she would have been the most depraved of human creatures  for the sake 
of a few jewels  to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend  
a child whom she had nursed from its birth  and appeared to love as if 
it had been her own  i could not consent to the death of any human 
being  but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to 
remain in the society of men  but she was innocent  i know  i feel 
she was innocent  you are of the same opinion  and that confirms me  
alas  victor  when falsehood can look so like the truth  who can 
assure themselves of certain happiness  i feel as if i were walking on 
the edge of a precipice  towards which thousands are crowding and 
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss  william and justine were 
assassinated  and the murderer escapes  he walks about the world free  
and perhaps respected  but even if i were condemned to suffer on the 
scaffold for the same crimes  i would not change places with such a 
wretch     
 
i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony  i  not in deed  
but in effect  was the true murderer  elizabeth read my anguish in my 
countenance  and kindly taking my hand  said     my dearest friend  you 
must calm yourself  these events have affected me  god knows how 
deeply  but i am not so wretched as you are  there is an expression of 
despair  and sometimes of revenge  in your countenance that makes me 
tremble  dear victor  banish these dark passions  remember the 
friends around you  who centre all their hopes in you  have we lost 
the power of rendering you happy  ah  while we love  while we are 
true to each other  here in this land of peace and beauty  your native 
country  we may reap every tranquil blessing   what can disturb our 
peace     
 
and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every 
other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my 
heart  even as she spoke i drew near to her  as if in terror  lest at 
that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her  
 
thus not the tenderness of friendship  nor the beauty of earth  nor of 
heaven  could redeem my soul from woe  the very accents of love were 
ineffectual  i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial 
influence could penetrate  the wounded deer dragging its fainting 
limbs to some untrodden brake  there to gaze upon the arrow which had 
pierced it  and to die  was but a type of me  
 
sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me  but 
sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek  by bodily 
exercise and by change of place  some relief from my intolerable 
sensations  it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left 
my home  and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys  sought 
in the magnificence  the eternity of such scenes  to forget myself and 
my ephemeral  because human  sorrows  my wanderings were directed 
towards the valley of chamounix  i had visited it frequently during my 
boyhood  six years had passed since then   i  was a wreck  but nought 
had changed in those savage and enduring scenes  
 
i performed the first part of my journey on horseback  i afterwards 
hired a mule  as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive 
injury on these rugged roads  the weather was fine  it was about the 
middle of the month of august  nearly two months after the death of 
justine  that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe  the 
weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in 
the ravine of arve  the immense mountains and precipices that overhung 
me on every side  the sound of the river raging among the rocks  and 
the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as 
omnipotence   and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less 
almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements  here 
displayed in their most terrific guise  still  as i ascended higher  
the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character  
ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains  the 
impetuous arve  and cottages every here and there peeping forth from 
among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty  but it was 
augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps  whose white and 
shining pyramids and domes towered above all  as belonging to another 
earth  the habitations of another race of beings  
 
i passed the bridge of p  lissier  where the ravine  which the river 
forms  opened before me  and i began to ascend the mountain that 
overhangs it  soon after  i entered the valley of chamounix  this 
valley is more wonderful and sublime  but not so beautiful and 
picturesque as that of servox  through which i had just passed  the 
high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries  but i saw no 
more ruined castles and fertile fields  immense glaciers approached 
the road  i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and 
marked the smoke of its passage  mont blanc  the supreme and 
magnificent mont blanc  raised itself from the surrounding  aiguilles   
and its tremendous  d  me  overlooked the valley  
 
a tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this 
journey  some turn in the road  some new object suddenly perceived and 
recognised  reminded me of days gone by  and were associated with the 
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood  the very winds whispered in soothing 
accents  and maternal nature bade me weep no more  then again the 
kindly influence ceased to act   i found myself fettered again to grief 
and indulging in all the misery of reflection  then i spurred on my 
animal  striving so to forget the world  my fears  and more than all  
myself   or  in a more desperate fashion  i alighted and threw myself on 
the grass  weighed down by horror and despair  
 
at length i arrived at the village of chamounix  exhaustion succeeded 
to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured  
for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid 
lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of 
the arve  which pursued its noisy way beneath  the same lulling sounds 
acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations  when i placed my head 
upon my pillow  sleep crept over me  i felt it as it came and blessed 
the giver of oblivion  
 
 
 
 
chapter 10 
 
 
i spent the following day roaming through the valley  i stood beside 
the sources of the arveiron  which take their rise in a glacier  that 
with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to 
barricade the valley  the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before 
me  the icy wall of the glacier overhung me  a few shattered pines were 
scattered around  and the solemn silence of this glorious 
presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling 
waves or the fall of some vast fragment  the thunder sound of the 
avalanche or the cracking  reverberated along the mountains  of the 
accumulated ice  which  through the silent working of immutable laws  
was ever and anon rent and torn  as if it had been but a plaything in 
their hands  these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the 
greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving  they elevated me 
from all littleness of feeling  and although they did not remove my 
grief  they subdued and tranquillised it  in some degree  also  they 
diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the 
last month  i retired to rest at night  my slumbers  as it were  
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i 
had contemplated during the day  they congregated round me  the 
unstained snowy mountain-top  the glittering pinnacle  the pine woods  
and ragged bare ravine  the eagle  soaring amidst the clouds   they all 
gathered round me and bade me be at peace  
 
where had they fled when the next morning i awoke  all of 
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep  and dark melancholy clouded every 
thought  the rain was pouring in torrents  and thick mists hid the 
summits of the mountains  so that i even saw not the faces of those 
mighty friends  still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them 
in their cloudy retreats  what were rain and storm to me  my mule was 
brought to the door  and i resolved to ascend to the summit of 
montanvert  i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous 
and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it  
it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the 
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy  
the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the 
effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing 
cares of life  i determined to go without a guide  for i was well 
acquainted with the path  and the presence of another would destroy the 
solitary grandeur of the scene  
 
the ascent is precipitous  but the path is cut into continual and short 
windings  which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the 
mountain  it is a scene terrifically desolate  in a thousand spots 
the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived  where trees lie 
broken and strewed on the ground  some entirely destroyed  others bent  
leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon 
other trees  the path  as you ascend higher  is intersected by ravines 
of snow  down which stones continually roll from above  one of them is 
particularly dangerous  as the slightest sound  such as even speaking 
in a loud voice  produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw 
destruction upon the head of the speaker  the pines are not tall or 
luxuriant  but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene  
i looked on the valley beneath  vast mists were rising from the rivers 
which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite 
mountains  whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds  while rain 
poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i 
received from the objects around me  alas  why does man boast of 
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute  it only renders 
them more necessary beings  if our impulses were confined to hunger  
thirst  and desire  we might be nearly free  but now we are moved by 
every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may 
convey to us  
 
  we rest  a dream has power to poison sleep  
     we rise  one wand   ring thought pollutes the day  
  we feel  conceive  or reason  laugh or weep  
     embrace fond woe  or cast our cares away  
  it is the same  for  be it joy or sorrow  
     the path of its departure still is free  
  man   s yesterday may ne   er be like his morrow  
     nought may endure but mutability  
 
 
it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent  for some 
time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice  a mist covered 
both that and the surrounding mountains  presently a breeze dissipated 
the cloud  and i descended upon the glacier  the surface is very 
uneven  rising like the waves of a troubled sea  descending low  and 
interspersed by rifts that sink deep  the field of ice is almost a 
league in width  but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it  the 
opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock  from the side where i 
now stood montanvert was exactly opposite  at the distance of a league  
and above it rose mont blanc  in awful majesty  i remained in a recess 
of the rock  gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene  the sea  
or rather the vast river of ice  wound among its dependent mountains  
whose aerial summits hung over its recesses  their icy and glittering 
peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds  my heart  which was 
before sorrowful  now swelled with something like joy  i exclaimed  
   wandering spirits  if indeed ye wander  and do not rest in your narrow 
beds  allow me this faint happiness  or take me  as your companion  
away from the joys of life     
 
as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man  at some distance  
advancing towards me with superhuman speed  he bounded over the 
crevices in the ice  among which i had walked with caution  his 
stature  also  as he approached  seemed to exceed that of man  i was 
troubled  a mist came over my eyes  and i felt a faintness seize me  
but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains  i 
perceived  as the shape came nearer  sight tremendous and abhorred   
that it was the wretch whom i had created  i trembled with rage and 
horror  resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in 
mortal combat  he approached  his countenance bespoke bitter anguish  
combined with disdain and malignity  while its unearthly ugliness 
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes  but i scarcely 
observed this  rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance  
and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious 
detestation and contempt  
 
   devil     i exclaimed     do you dare approach me  and do 
not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head  
begone  vile insect  or rather  stay  that i may trample you to dust  and  
oh  that i could  with the extinction of your miserable existence  restore 
those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered     
 
   i expected this reception     said the d  mon     all men hate the 
wretched  how  then  must i be hated  who am miserable beyond all 
living things  yet you  my creator  detest and spurn me  thy creature  
to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of 
one of us  you purpose to kill me  how dare you sport thus with life  
do your duty towards me  and i will do mine towards you and the rest of 
mankind  if you will comply with my conditions  i will leave them and 
you at peace  but if you refuse  i will glut the maw of death  until it 
be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends     
 
   abhorred monster  fiend that thou art  the tortures of hell are too 
mild a vengeance for thy crimes  wretched devil  you reproach me with 
your creation  come on  then  that i may extinguish the spark which i 
so negligently bestowed     
 
my rage was without bounds  i sprang on him  impelled by all the 
feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another  
 
he easily eluded me and said  
 
   be calm  i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred 
on my devoted head  have i not suffered enough  that you seek to 
increase my misery  life  although it may only be an accumulation of 
anguish  is dear to me  and i will defend it  remember  thou hast made 
me more powerful than thyself  my height is superior to thine  my 
joints more supple  but i will not be tempted to set myself in 
opposition to thee  i am thy creature  and i will be even mild and 
docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part  
the which thou owest me  oh  frankenstein  be not equitable to every 
other and trample upon me alone  to whom thy justice  and even thy 
clemency and affection  is most due  remember that i am thy creature  
i ought to be thy adam  but i am rather the fallen angel  whom thou 
drivest from joy for no misdeed  everywhere i see bliss  from which i 
alone am irrevocably excluded  i was benevolent and good  misery made 
me a fiend  make me happy  and i shall again be virtuous     
 
   begone  i will not hear you  there can be no community between you 
and me  we are enemies  begone  or let us try our strength in a fight  
in which one must fall     
 
   how can i move thee  will no entreaties cause thee to turn a 
favourable eye upon thy creature  who implores thy goodness and 
compassion  believe me  frankenstein  i was benevolent  my soul glowed 
with love and humanity  but am i not alone  miserably alone  you  my 
creator  abhor me  what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures  
who owe me nothing  they spurn and hate me  the desert mountains and 
dreary glaciers are my refuge  i have wandered here many days  the 
caves of ice  which i only do not fear  are a dwelling to me  and the 
only one which man does not grudge  these bleak skies i hail  for they 
are kinder to me than your fellow beings  if the multitude of mankind 
knew of my existence  they would do as you do  and arm themselves for 
my destruction  shall i not then hate them who abhor me  i will keep 
no terms with my enemies  i am miserable  and they shall share my 
wretchedness  yet it is in your power to recompense me  and deliver 
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great  that 
not only you and your family  but thousands of others  shall be 
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage  let your compassion be 
moved  and do not disdain me  listen to my tale  when you have heard 
that  abandon or commiserate me  as you shall judge that i deserve  
but hear me  the guilty are allowed  by human laws  bloody as they 
are  to speak in their own defence before they are condemned  listen 
to me  frankenstein  you accuse me of murder  and yet you would  with 
a satisfied conscience  destroy your own creature  oh  praise the 
eternal justice of man  yet i ask you not to spare me  listen to me  
and then  if you can  and if you will  destroy the work of your hands     
 
   why do you call to my remembrance     i rejoined     circumstances of 
which i shudder to reflect  that i have been the miserable origin and 
author  cursed be the day  abhorred devil  in which you first saw 
light  cursed  although i curse myself  be the hands that formed you  
you have made me wretched beyond expression  you have left me no power 
to consider whether i am just to you or not  begone  relieve me from 
the sight of your detested form     
 
   thus i relieve thee  my creator     he said  and placed his hated hands 
before my eyes  which i flung from me with violence     thus i take from 
thee a sight which you abhor  still thou canst listen to me and grant 
me thy compassion  by the virtues that i once possessed  i demand this 
from you  hear my tale  it is long and strange  and the temperature of 
this place is not fitting to your fine sensations  come to the hut upon 
the mountain  the sun is yet high in the heavens  before it descends 
to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another 
world  you will have heard my story and can decide  on you it rests  
whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless 
life  or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of 
your own speedy ruin     
 
as he said this he led the way across the ice  i followed  my heart 
was full  and i did not answer him  but as i proceeded  i weighed the 
various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to 
his tale  i was partly urged by curiosity  and compassion confirmed my 
resolution  i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my 
brother  and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion  
for the first time  also  i felt what the duties of a creator towards 
his creature were  and that i ought to render him happy before i 
complained of his wickedness  these motives urged me to comply with 
his demand  we crossed the ice  therefore  and ascended the opposite 
rock  the air was cold  and the rain again began to descend  we 
entered the hut  the fiend with an air of exultation  i with a heavy 
heart and depressed spirits  but i consented to listen  and seating 
myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted  he thus began 
his tale  
 
 
 
 
chapter 11 
 
 
   it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of 
my being  all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct  
a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me  and i saw  felt  heard  
and smelt at the same time  and it was  indeed  a long time before i 
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses  by 
degrees  i remember  a stronger light pressed upon my nerves  so that i 
was obliged to shut my eyes  darkness then came over me and troubled 
me  but hardly had i felt this when  by opening my eyes  as i now 
suppose  the light poured in upon me again  i walked and  i believe  
descended  but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations  
before  dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me  impervious to my 
touch or sight  but i now found that i could wander on at liberty  with 
no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid  the light 
became more and more oppressive to me  and the heat wearying me as i 
walked  i sought a place where i could receive shade  this was the 
forest near ingolstadt  and here i lay by the side of a brook resting 
from my fatigue  until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst  this 
roused me from my nearly dormant state  and i ate some berries which i 
found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground  i slaked my thirst 
at the brook  and then lying down  was overcome by sleep  
 
   it was dark when i awoke  i felt cold also  and half frightened  as it 
were  instinctively  finding myself so desolate  before i had quitted 
your apartment  on a sensation of cold  i had covered myself with some 
clothes  but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of 
night  i was a poor  helpless  miserable wretch  i knew  and could 
distinguish  nothing  but feeling pain invade me on all sides  i sat 
down and wept  
 
   soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of 
pleasure  i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the 
trees   the moon  i gazed with a kind of wonder  it moved slowly  
but it enlightened my path  and i again went out in search of berries  
i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak  with 
which i covered myself  and sat down upon the ground  no distinct 
ideas occupied my mind  all was confused  i felt light  and hunger  
and thirst  and darkness  innumerable sounds rang in my ears  and on 
all sides various scents saluted me  the only object that i could 
distinguish was the bright moon  and i fixed my eyes on that with 
pleasure  
 
   several changes of day and night passed  and the orb of night had 
greatly lessened  when i began to distinguish my sensations from each 
other  i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with 
drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage  i was delighted 
when i first discovered that a pleasant sound  which often saluted my 
ears  proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had 
often intercepted the light from my eyes  i began also to observe  
with greater accuracy  the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the 
boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me  sometimes i 
tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable  
sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode  but the 
uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into 
silence again  
 
   the moon had disappeared from the night  and again  with a lessened 
form  showed itself  while i still remained in the forest  my 
sensations had by this time become distinct  and my mind received every 
day additional ideas  my eyes became accustomed to the light and to 
perceive objects in their right forms  i distinguished the insect from 
the herb  and by degrees  one herb from another  i found that the 
sparrow uttered none but harsh notes  whilst those of the blackbird and 
thrush were sweet and enticing  
 
   one day  when i was oppressed by cold  i found a fire which had been 
left by some wandering beggars  and was overcome with delight at the 
warmth i experienced from it  in my joy i thrust my hand into the live 
embers  but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain  how strange  
i thought  that the same cause should produce such opposite effects  i 
examined the materials of the fire  and to my joy found it to be 
composed of wood  i quickly collected some branches  but they were wet 
and would not burn  i was pained at this and sat still watching the 
operation of the fire  the wet wood which i had placed near the heat 
dried and itself became inflamed  i reflected on this  and by touching 
the various branches  i discovered the cause and busied myself in 
collecting a great quantity of wood  that i might dry it and have a 
plentiful supply of fire  when night came on and brought sleep with 
it  i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished  i 
covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches 
upon it  and then  spreading my cloak  i lay on the ground and sank 
into sleep  
 
   it was morning when i awoke  and my first care was to visit the fire  
i uncovered it  and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame  i 
observed this also and contrived a fan of branches  which roused the 
embers when they were nearly extinguished  when night came again i 
found  with pleasure  that the fire gave light as well as heat and that 
the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food  for i found 
some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted  and 
tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees  i 
tried  therefore  to dress my food in the same manner  placing it on 
the live embers  i found that the berries were spoiled by this 
operation  and the nuts and roots much improved  
 
   food  however  became scarce  and i often spent the whole day 
searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger  when 
i found this  i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto 
inhabited  to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be 
more easily satisfied  in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the 
loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how 
to reproduce it  i gave several hours to the serious consideration of 
this difficulty  but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply 
it  and wrapping myself up in my cloak  i struck across the wood 
towards the setting sun  i passed three days in these rambles and at 
length discovered the open country  a great fall of snow had taken 
place the night before  and the fields were of one uniform white  the 
appearance was disconsolate  and i found my feet chilled by the cold 
damp substance that covered the ground  
 
   it was about seven in the morning  and i longed to obtain food and 
shelter  at length i perceived a small hut  on a rising ground  which 
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd  this 
was a new sight to me  and i examined the structure with great 
curiosity  finding the door open  i entered  an old man sat in it  
near a fire  over which he was preparing his breakfast  he turned on 
hearing a noise  and perceiving me  shrieked loudly  and quitting the 
hut  ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form 
hardly appeared capable  his appearance  different from any i had ever 
before seen  and his flight somewhat surprised me  but i was enchanted 
by the appearance of the hut  here the snow and rain could not 
penetrate  the ground was dry  and it presented to me then as exquisite 
and divine a retreat as pand  monium appeared to the d  mons of hell 
after their sufferings in the lake of fire  i greedily devoured the 
remnants of the shepherd   s breakfast  which consisted of bread  cheese  
milk  and wine  the latter  however  i did not like  then  overcome by 
fatigue  i lay down among some straw and fell asleep  
 
   it was noon when i awoke  and allured by the warmth of the sun  which 
shone brightly on the white ground  i determined to recommence my 
travels  and  depositing the remains of the peasant   s breakfast in a 
wallet i found  i proceeded across the fields for several hours  until 
at sunset i arrived at a village  how miraculous did this appear  the 
huts  the neater cottages  and stately houses engaged my admiration by 
turns  the vegetables in the gardens  the milk and cheese that i saw 
placed at the windows of some of the cottages  allured my appetite  one 
of the best of these i entered  but i had hardly placed my foot within 
the door before the children shrieked  and one of the women fainted  
the whole village was roused  some fled  some attacked me  until  
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons  i 
escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel  
quite bare  and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had 
beheld in the village  this hovel however  joined a cottage of a neat 
and pleasant appearance  but after my late dearly bought experience  i 
dared not enter it  my place of refuge was constructed of wood  but so 
low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it  no wood  however  
was placed on the earth  which formed the floor  but it was dry  and 
although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks  i found it an 
agreeable asylum from the snow and rain  
 
   here  then  i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter  
however miserable  from the inclemency of the season  and still more 
from the barbarity of man  as soon as morning dawned i crept from my 
kennel  that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could 
remain in the habitation i had found  it was situated against the back 
of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig 
sty and a clear pool of water  one part was open  and by that i had 
crept in  but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived 
with stones and wood  yet in such a manner that i might move them on 
occasion to pass out  all the light i enjoyed came through the sty  and 
that was sufficient for me  
 
   having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw  i 
retired  for i saw the figure of a man at a distance  and i remembered 
too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power  i 
had first  however  provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf 
of coarse bread  which i purloined  and a cup with which i could drink 
more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by 
my retreat  the floor was a little raised  so that it was kept 
perfectly dry  and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was 
tolerably warm  
 
   being thus provided  i resolved to reside in this hovel until 
something should occur which might alter my determination  it was 
indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest  my former residence  
the rain-dropping branches  and dank earth  i ate my breakfast with 
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little 
water when i heard a step  and looking through a small chink  i beheld 
a young creature  with a pail on her head  passing before my hovel  the 
girl was young and of gentle demeanour  unlike what i have since found 
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be  yet she was meanly dressed  a 
coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb  her fair 
hair was plaited but not adorned  she looked patient yet sad  i lost 
sight of her  and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing 
the pail  which was now partly filled with milk  as she walked along  
seemingly incommoded by the burden  a young man met her  whose 
countenance expressed a deeper despondence  uttering a few sounds with 
an air of melancholy  he took the pail from her head and bore it to the 
cottage himself  she followed  and they disappeared  presently i saw 
the young man again  with some tools in his hand  cross the field 
behind the cottage  and the girl was also busied  sometimes in the 
house and sometimes in the yard  
 
   on examining my dwelling  i found that one of the windows of the 
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it  but the panes had been 
filled up with wood  in one of these was a small and almost 
imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate  
through this crevice a small room was visible  whitewashed and clean 
but very bare of furniture  in one corner  near a small fire  sat an 
old man  leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude  the 
young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage  but presently she 
took something out of a drawer  which employed her hands  and she sat 
down beside the old man  who  taking up an instrument  began to play 
and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the 
nightingale  it was a lovely sight  even to me  poor wretch who had 
never beheld aught beautiful before  the silver hair and benevolent 
countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence  while the gentle 
manners of the girl enticed my love  he played a sweet mournful air 
which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion  of 
which the old man took no notice  until she sobbed audibly  he then 
pronounced a few sounds  and the fair creature  leaving her work  knelt 
at his feet  he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection 
that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature  they were 
a mixture of pain and pleasure  such as i had never before experienced  
either from hunger or cold  warmth or food  and i withdrew from the 
window  unable to bear these emotions  
 
   soon after this the young man returned  bearing on his shoulders a 
load of wood  the girl met him at the door  helped to relieve him of 
his burden  and taking some of the fuel into the cottage  placed it on 
the fire  then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage  
and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese  she seemed 
pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants  which she 
placed in water  and then upon the fire  she afterwards continued her 
work  whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily 
employed in digging and pulling up roots  after he had been employed 
thus about an hour  the young woman joined him and they entered the 
cottage together  
 
   the old man had  in the meantime  been pensive  but on the appearance 
of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air  and they sat down to 
eat  the meal was quickly dispatched  the young woman was again 
occupied in arranging the cottage  the old man walked before the 
cottage in the sun for a few minutes  leaning on the arm of the youth  
nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent 
creatures  one was old  with silver hairs and a countenance beaming 
with benevolence and love  the younger was slight and graceful in his 
figure  and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry  yet his 
eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency  the 
old man returned to the cottage  and the youth  with tools different 
from those he had used in the morning  directed his steps across the 
fields  
 
   night quickly shut in  but to my extreme wonder  i found that the 
cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers  and was 
delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the 
pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours  in the evening 
the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations 
which i did not understand  and the old man again took up the 
instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in 
the morning  so soon as he had finished  the youth began  not to play  
but to utter sounds that were monotonous  and neither resembling the 
harmony of the old man   s instrument nor the songs of the birds  i since 
found that he read aloud  but at that time i knew nothing of the 
science of words or letters  
 
   the family  after having been thus occupied for a short time  
extinguished their lights and retired  as i conjectured  to rest     
 
 
 
 
chapter 12 
 
 
   i lay on my straw  but i could not sleep  i thought of the 
occurrences of the day  what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners 
of these people  and i longed to join them  but dared not  i 
remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from 
the barbarous villagers  and resolved  whatever course of conduct i 
might hereafter think it right to pursue  that for the present i would 
remain quietly in my hovel  watching and endeavouring to discover the 
motives which influenced their actions  
 
   the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun  the young woman 
arranged the cottage and prepared the food  and the youth departed 
after the first meal  
 
   this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it  
the young man was constantly employed out of doors  and the girl in 
various laborious occupations within  the old man  whom i soon 
perceived to be blind  employed his leisure hours on his instrument or 
in contemplation  nothing could exceed the love and respect which the 
younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion  they 
performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with 
gentleness  and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles  
 
   they were not entirely happy  the young man and his companion often 
went apart and appeared to weep  i saw no cause for their unhappiness  
but i was deeply affected by it  if such lovely creatures were 
miserable  it was less strange that i  an imperfect and solitary being  
should be wretched  yet why were these gentle beings unhappy  they 
possessed a delightful house  for such it was in my eyes  and every 
luxury  they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands 
when hungry  they were dressed in excellent clothes  and  still more  
they enjoyed one another   s company and speech  interchanging each day 
looks of affection and kindness  what did their tears imply  did they 
really express pain  i was at first unable to solve these questions  
but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which 
were at first enigmatic  
 
   a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of 
the uneasiness of this amiable family  it was poverty  and they 
suffered that evil in a very distressing degree  their nourishment 
consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of 
one cow  which gave very little during the winter  when its masters 
could scarcely procure food to support it  they often  i believe  
suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly  especially the two 
younger cottagers  for several times they placed food before the old 
man when they reserved none for themselves  
 
   this trait of kindness moved me sensibly  i had been accustomed  
during the night  to steal a part of their store for my own 
consumption  but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on 
the cottagers  i abstained and satisfied myself with berries  nuts  and 
roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood  
 
   i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist 
their labours  i found that the youth spent a great part of each day 
in collecting wood for the family fire  and during the night i often 
took his tools  the use of which i quickly discovered  and brought home 
firing sufficient for the consumption of several days  
 
   i remember  the first time that i did this  the young woman  when she 
opened the door in the morning  appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great 
pile of wood on the outside  she uttered some words in a loud voice  and the 
youth joined her  who also expressed surprise  i observed  with pleasure  
that he did not go to the forest that day  but spent it in repairing the 
cottage and cultivating the garden  
 
   by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment  i found that 
these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and 
feelings to one another by articulate sounds  i perceived that the words 
they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain  smiles or sadness  in the 
minds and countenances of the hearers  this was indeed a godlike science  
and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it  but i was baffled in 
every attempt i made for this purpose  their pronunciation was quick  and 
the words they uttered  not having any apparent connection with visible 
objects  i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the 
mystery of their reference  by great application  however  and after having 
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel  i 
discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of 
discourse  i learned and applied the words   fire  milk  bread   and 
 wood   i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves  the youth 
and his companion had each of them several names  but the old man had only 
one  which was  father   the girl was called  sister  or 
 agatha   and the youth  felix  brother   or  son   i cannot 
describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of 
these sounds and was able to pronounce them  i distinguished several other 
words without being able as yet to understand or apply them  such as  good  
dearest  unhappy   
 
   i spent the winter in this manner  the gentle manners and beauty of 
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me  when they were unhappy  i 
felt depressed  when they rejoiced  i sympathised in their joys  i saw 
few human beings besides them  and if any other happened to enter the 
cottage  their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the 
superior accomplishments of my friends  the old man  i could perceive  
often endeavoured to encourage his children  as sometimes i found that 
he called them  to cast off their melancholy  he would talk in a 
cheerful accent  with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure 
even upon me  agatha listened with respect  her eyes sometimes filled 
with tears  which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived  but i 
generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after 
having listened to the exhortations of her father  it was not thus 
with felix  he was always the saddest of the group  and even to my 
unpractised senses  he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his 
friends  but if his countenance was more sorrowful  his voice was more 
cheerful than that of his sister  especially when he addressed the old 
man  
 
   i could mention innumerable instances which  although slight  marked 
the dispositions of these amiable cottagers  in the midst of poverty 
and want  felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little 
white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground  early in 
the morning  before she had risen  he cleared away the snow that 
obstructed her path to the milk-house  drew water from the well  and 
brought the wood from the outhouse  where  to his perpetual 
astonishment  he found his store always replenished by an invisible 
hand  in the day  i believe  he worked sometimes for a neighbouring 
farmer  because he often went forth and did not return until dinner  
yet brought no wood with him  at other times he worked in the garden  
but as there was little to do in the frosty season  he read to the old 
man and agatha  
 
   this reading had puzzled me extremely at first  but by degrees i 
discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when 
he talked  i conjectured  therefore  that he found on the paper signs 
for speech which he understood  and i ardently longed to comprehend 
these also  but how was that possible when i did not even understand 
the sounds for which they stood as signs  i improved  however  
sensibly in this science  but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of 
conversation  although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour  for i 
easily perceived that  although i eagerly longed to discover myself to 
the cottagers  i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become 
master of their language  which knowledge might enable me to make them 
overlook the deformity of my figure  for with this also the contrast 
perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted  
 
   i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers   their grace  beauty  
and delicate complexions  but how was i terrified when i viewed myself 
in a transparent pool  at first i started back  unable to believe that 
it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror  and when i became 
fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am  i was 
filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification  
alas  i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable 
deformity  
 
   as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer  the snow 
vanished  and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth  from this 
time felix was more employed  and the heart-moving indications of 
impending famine disappeared  their food  as i afterwards found  was 
coarse  but it was wholesome  and they procured a sufficiency of it  
several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden  which they 
dressed  and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season 
advanced  
 
   the old man  leaning on his son  walked each day at noon  when it did 
not rain  as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its 
waters  this frequently took place  but a high wind quickly dried the 
earth  and the season became far more pleasant than it had been  
 
   my mode of life in my hovel was uniform  during the morning i 
attended the motions of the cottagers  and when they were dispersed in 
various occupations  i slept  the remainder of the day was spent in 
observing my friends  when they had retired to rest  if there was any 
moon or the night was star-light  i went into the woods and collected 
my own food and fuel for the cottage  when i returned  as often as it 
was necessary  i cleared their path from the snow and performed those 
offices that i had seen done by felix  i afterwards found that these 
labours  performed by an invisible hand  greatly astonished them  and 
once or twice i heard them  on these occasions  utter the words  good 
spirit  wonderful   but i did not then understand the signification 
of these terms  
 
   my thoughts now became more active  and i longed to discover the 
motives and feelings of these lovely creatures  i was inquisitive to 
know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad  i thought 
 foolish wretch   that it might be in my power to restore happiness to 
these deserving people  when i slept or was absent  the forms of the 
venerable blind father  the gentle agatha  and the excellent felix 
flitted before me  i looked upon them as superior beings who would be 
the arbiters of my future destiny  i formed in my imagination a 
thousand pictures of presenting myself to them  and their reception of 
me  i imagined that they would be disgusted  until  by my gentle 
demeanour and conciliating words  i should first win their favour and 
afterwards their love  
 
   these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to 
the acquiring the art of language  my organs were indeed harsh  but 
supple  and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their 
tones  yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease  
it was as the ass and the lap-dog  yet surely the gentle ass whose 
intentions were affectionate  although his manners were rude  deserved 
better treatment than blows and execration  
 
   the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the 
aspect of the earth  men who before this change seemed to have been 
hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of 
cultivation  the birds sang in more cheerful notes  and the leaves 
began to bud forth on the trees  happy  happy earth  fit habitation 
for gods  which  so short a time before  was bleak  damp  and 
unwholesome  my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of 
nature  the past was blotted from my memory  the present was tranquil  
and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy     
 
 
 
 
chapter 13 
 
 
   i now hasten to the more moving part of my story  i shall relate 
events that impressed me with feelings which  from what i had been  
have made me what i am  
 
   spring advanced rapidly  the weather became fine and the skies 
cloudless  it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy 
should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure  my 
senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and 
a thousand sights of beauty  
 
   it was on one of these days  when my cottagers periodically rested 
from labour   the old man played on his guitar  and the children 
listened to him   that i observed the countenance of felix was 
melancholy beyond expression  he sighed frequently  and once his father 
paused in his music  and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired 
the cause of his son   s sorrow  felix replied in a cheerful accent  and 
the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door  
 
   it was a lady on horseback  accompanied by a country-man as a guide  
the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black 
veil  agatha asked a question  to which the stranger only replied by 
pronouncing  in a sweet accent  the name of felix  her voice was 
musical but unlike that of either of my friends  on hearing this word  
felix came up hastily to the lady  who  when she saw him  threw up her 
veil  and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression  her 
hair of a shining raven black  and curiously braided  her eyes were 
dark  but gentle  although animated  her features of a regular 
proportion  and her complexion wondrously fair  each cheek tinged with 
a lovely pink  
 
   felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her  every trait of 
sorrow vanished from his face  and it instantly expressed a degree of 
ecstatic joy  of which i could hardly have believed it capable  his 
eyes sparkled  as his cheek flushed with pleasure  and at that moment i 
thought him as beautiful as the stranger  she appeared affected by 
different feelings  wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes  she held 
out her hand to felix  who kissed it rapturously and called her  as 
well as i could distinguish  his sweet arabian  she did not appear to 
understand him  but smiled  he assisted her to dismount  and 
dismissing her guide  conducted her into the cottage  some 
conversation took place between him and his father  and the young 
stranger knelt at the old man   s feet and would have kissed his hand  
but he raised her and embraced her affectionately  
 
   i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds 
and appeared to have a language of her own  she was neither understood 
by nor herself understood the cottagers  they made many signs which i 
did not comprehend  but i saw that her presence diffused gladness 
through the cottage  dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the 
morning mists  felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of 
delight welcomed his arabian  agatha  the ever-gentle agatha  kissed 
the hands of the lovely stranger  and pointing to her brother  made 
signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she 
came  some hours passed thus  while they  by their countenances  
expressed joy  the cause of which i did not comprehend  presently i 
found  by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger 
repeated after them  that she was endeavouring to learn their language  
and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the 
same instructions to the same end  the stranger learned about twenty 
words at the first lesson  most of them  indeed  were those which i had 
before understood  but i profited by the others  
 
   as night came on  agatha and the arabian retired early  when they 
separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said     good night 
sweet safie     he sat up much longer  conversing with his father  and 
by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely 
guest was the subject of their conversation  i ardently desired to 
understand them  and bent every faculty towards that purpose  but found 
it utterly impossible  
 
   the next morning felix went out to his work  and after the usual 
occupations of agatha were finished  the arabian sat at the feet of the 
old man  and taking his guitar  played some airs so entrancingly 
beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my 
eyes  she sang  and her voice flowed in a rich cadence  swelling or 
dying away like a nightingale of the woods  
 
   when she had finished  she gave the guitar to agatha  who at first 
declined it  she played a simple air  and her voice accompanied it in 
sweet accents  but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger  the old 
man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to 
explain to safie  and by which he appeared to wish to express that she 
bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music  
 
   the days now passed as peaceably as before  with the sole alteration 
that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends  
safie was always gay and happy  she and i improved rapidly in the 
knowledge of language  so that in two months i began to comprehend most 
of the words uttered by my protectors  
 
   in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage  and 
the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers  sweet to the 
scent and the eyes  stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods  
the sun became warmer  the nights clear and balmy  and my nocturnal 
rambles were an extreme pleasure to me  although they were considerably 
shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun  for i never 
ventured abroad during daylight  fearful of meeting with the same 
treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered  
 
   my days were spent in close attention  that i might more speedily 
master the language  and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than 
the arabian  who understood very little and conversed in broken 
accents  whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that 
was spoken  
 
   while i improved in speech  i also learned the science of letters as 
it was taught to the stranger  and this opened before me a wide field 
for wonder and delight  
 
   the book from which felix instructed safie was volney   s  ruins 
of empires   i should not have understood the purport of this book had not 
felix  in reading it  given very minute explanations  he had chosen this 
work  he said  because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the 
eastern authors  through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history 
and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world  it gave 
me an insight into the manners  governments  and religions of the different 
nations of the earth  i heard of the slothful asiatics  of the stupendous 
genius and mental activity of the grecians  of the wars and wonderful virtue 
of the early romans   of their subsequent degenerating   of the 
decline of that mighty empire  of chivalry  christianity  and kings  i heard 
of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the 
hapless fate of its original inhabitants  
 
   these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings  was 
man  indeed  at once so powerful  so virtuous and magnificent  yet so 
vicious and base  he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil 
principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and 
godlike  to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour 
that can befall a sensitive being  to be base and vicious  as many on 
record have been  appeared the lowest degradation  a condition more 
abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm  for a long time i 
could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow  or 
even why there were laws and governments  but when i heard details of 
vice and bloodshed  my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and 
loathing  
 
   every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me  
while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the 
arabian  the strange system of human society was explained to me  i 
heard of the division of property  of immense wealth and squalid 
poverty  of rank  descent  and noble blood  
 
   the words induced me to turn towards myself  i learned that the 
possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and 
unsullied descent united with riches  a man might be respected with 
only one of these advantages  but without either he was considered  
except in very rare instances  as a vagabond and a slave  doomed to 
waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few  and what was i  of 
my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant  but i knew that i 
possessed no money  no friends  no kind of property  i was  besides  
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome  i was not even 
of the same nature as man  i was more agile than they and could 
subsist upon coarser diet  i bore the extremes of heat and cold with 
less injury to my frame  my stature far exceeded theirs  when i looked 
around i saw and heard of none like me  was i  then  a monster  a blot 
upon the earth  from which all men fled and whom all men disowned  
 
   i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted 
upon me  i tried to dispel them  but sorrow only increased with 
knowledge  oh  that i had for ever remained in my native wood  nor 
known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger  thirst  and heat  
 
   of what a strange nature is knowledge  it clings to the mind when it 
has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock  i wished sometimes to 
shake off all thought and feeling  but i learned that there was but one 
means to overcome the sensation of pain  and that was death   a state 
which i feared yet did not understand  i admired virtue and good 
feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my 
cottagers  but i was shut out from intercourse with them  except 
through means which i obtained by stealth  when i was unseen and 
unknown  and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of 
becoming one among my fellows  the gentle words of agatha and the 
animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me  the mild 
exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved 
felix were not for me  miserable  unhappy wretch  
 
   other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply  i heard of the 
difference of sexes  and the birth and growth of children  how the 
father doted on the smiles of the infant  and the lively sallies of the 
older child  how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up 
in the precious charge  how the mind of youth expanded and gained 
knowledge  of brother  sister  and all the various relationships which 
bind one human being to another in mutual bonds  
 
   but where were my friends and relations  no father had watched my 
infant days  no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses  or if 
they had  all my past life was now a blot  a blind vacancy in which i 
distinguished nothing  from my earliest remembrance i had been as i 
then was in height and proportion  i had never yet seen a being 
resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me  what was i  the 
question again recurred  to be answered only with groans  
 
   i will soon explain to what these feelings tended  but allow me now to 
return to the cottagers  whose story excited in me such various 
feelings of indignation  delight  and wonder  but which all terminated 
in additional love and reverence for my protectors  for so i loved  in 
an innocent  half-painful self-deceit  to call them      
 
 
 
 
chapter 14 
 
 
   some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends  it was 
one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind  unfolding 
as it did a number of circumstances  each interesting and wonderful to 
one so utterly inexperienced as i was  
 
   the name of the old man was de lacey  he was descended from a good 
family in france  where he had lived for many years in affluence  
respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals  his son was bred 
in the service of his country  and agatha had ranked with ladies of the 
highest distinction  a few months before my arrival they had lived in 
a large and luxurious city called paris  surrounded by friends and 
possessed of every enjoyment which virtue  refinement of intellect  or 
taste  accompanied by a moderate fortune  could afford  
 
   the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin  he was a 
turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years  when  for some 
reason which i could not learn  he became obnoxious to the government  
he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from 
constantinople to join him  he was tried and condemned to death  the 
injustice of his sentence was very flagrant  all paris was indignant  
and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime 
alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation  
 
   felix had accidentally been present at the trial  his horror and 
indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the 
court  he made  at that moment  a solemn vow to deliver him and then 
looked around for the means  after many fruitless attempts to gain 
admittance to the prison  he found a strongly grated window in an 
unguarded part of the building  which lighted the dungeon of the 
unfortunate muhammadan  who  loaded with chains  waited in despair the 
execution of the barbarous sentence  felix visited the grate at night 
and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour  the turk  
amazed and delighted  endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer 
by promises of reward and wealth  felix rejected his offers with 
contempt  yet when he saw the lovely safie  who was allowed to visit 
her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude  the 
youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed 
a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard  
 
   the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made 
on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in 
his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he 
should be conveyed to a place of safety  felix was too delicate to 
accept this offer  yet he looked forward to the probability of the 
event as to the consummation of his happiness  
 
   during the ensuing days  while the preparations were going forward for 
the escape of the merchant  the zeal of felix was warmed by several 
letters that he received from this lovely girl  who found means to 
express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old 
man  a servant of her father who understood french  she thanked him in 
the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent  and 
at the same time she gently deplored her own fate  
 
   i have copies of these letters  for i found means  during my residence 
in the hovel  to procure the implements of writing  and the letters 
were often in the hands of felix or agatha  before i depart i will 
give them to you  they will prove the truth of my tale  but at present  
as the sun is already far declined  i shall only have time to repeat 
the substance of them to you  
 
   safie related that her mother was a christian arab  seized and made a 
slave by the turks  recommended by her beauty  she had won the heart of 
the father of safie  who married her  the young girl spoke in high and 
enthusiastic terms of her mother  who  born in freedom  spurned the 
bondage to which she was now reduced  she instructed her daughter in 
the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of 
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female 
followers of muhammad  this lady died  but her lessons were indelibly 
impressed on the mind of safie  who sickened at the prospect of again 
returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem  
allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements  ill-suited to 
the temper of her soul  now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble 
emulation for virtue  the prospect of marrying a christian and 
remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in 
society was enchanting to her  
 
   the day for the execution of the turk was fixed  but on the night 
previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant 
many leagues from paris  felix had procured passports in the name of 
his father  sister  and himself  he had previously communicated his 
plan to the former  who aided the deceit by quitting his house  under 
the pretence of a journey and concealed himself  with his daughter  in 
an obscure part of paris  
 
   felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont 
cenis to leghorn  where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable 
opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions  
 
   safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his 
departure  before which time the turk renewed his promise that she 
should be united to his deliverer  and felix remained with them in 
expectation of that event  and in the meantime he enjoyed the society 
of the arabian  who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest 
affection  they conversed with one another through the means of an 
interpreter  and sometimes with the interpretation of looks  and safie 
sang to him the divine airs of her native country  
 
   the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes 
of the youthful lovers  while in his heart he had formed far other 
plans  he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a 
christian  but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear 
lukewarm  for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer 
if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they 
inhabited  he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled 
to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary  and 
secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed  his plans 
were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris  
 
   the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their 
victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer  the 
plot of felix was quickly discovered  and de lacey and agatha were 
thrown into prison  the news reached felix and roused him from his 
dream of pleasure  his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay 
in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of 
her whom he loved  this idea was torture to him  he quickly arranged 
with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity 
for escape before felix could return to italy  safie should remain as a 
boarder at a convent at leghorn  and then  quitting the lovely arabian  
he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the 
law  hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding  
 
   he did not succeed  they remained confined for five months before the 
trial took place  the result of which deprived them of their fortune 
and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country  
 
   they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany  where i 
discovered them  felix soon learned that the treacherous turk  for 
whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression  on 
discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin  
became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with 
his daughter  insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him  
as he said  in some plan of future maintenance  
 
   such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered 
him  when i first saw him  the most miserable of his family  he could 
have endured poverty  and while this distress had been the meed of his 
virtue  he gloried in it  but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss 
of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable  the 
arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul  
 
   when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth 
and rank  the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her 
lover  but to prepare to return to her native country  the generous 
nature of safie was outraged by this command  she attempted to 
expostulate with her father  but he left her angrily  reiterating his 
tyrannical mandate  
 
   a few days after  the turk entered his daughter   s apartment and told 
her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn 
had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the 
french government  he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to 
constantinople  for which city he should sail in a few hours  he 
intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential 
servant  to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his 
property  which had not yet arrived at leghorn  
 
   when alone  safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it 
would become her to pursue in this emergency  a residence in turkey 
was abhorrent to her  her religion and her feelings were alike averse 
to it  by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she 
heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where 
he then resided  she hesitated some time  but at length she formed her 
determination  taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a 
sum of money  she quitted italy with an attendant  a native of leghorn  
but who understood the common language of turkey  and departed for 
germany  
 
   she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage 
of de lacey  when her attendant fell dangerously ill  safie nursed her 
with the most devoted affection  but the poor girl died  and the 
arabian was left alone  unacquainted with the language of the country 
and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world  she fell  however  
into good hands  the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for 
which they were bound  and after her death the woman of the house in 
which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at 
the cottage of her lover     
 
 
 
 
chapter 15 
 
 
   such was the history of my beloved cottagers  it impressed me deeply  
i learned  from the views of social life which it developed  to admire 
their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind  
 
   as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil  benevolence and 
generosity were ever present before me  inciting within me a desire to 
become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities 
were called forth and displayed  but in giving an account of the 
progress of my intellect  i must not omit a circumstance which occurred 
in the beginning of the month of august of the same year  
 
   one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i 
collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors  i found on 
the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and 
some books  i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel   
fortunately the books were written in the language  the elements of which i 
had acquired at the cottage  they consisted of  paradise lost   a volume 
of  plutarch   s lives   and the  sorrows of werter   the 
possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight  i now continually 
studied and exercised my mind upon these histories  whilst my friends were 
employed in their ordinary occupations  
 
   i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books  they produced 
in me an infinity of new images and feelings  that sometimes raised me 
to ecstasy  but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection  in 
the  sorrows of werter   besides the interest of its simple and affecting 
story  so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon 
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a 
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment  the gentle and 
domestic manners it described  combined with lofty sentiments and 
feelings  which had for their object something out of self  accorded 
well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which 
were for ever alive in my own bosom  but i thought werter himself a 
more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined  his character 
contained no pretension  but it sank deep  the disquisitions upon 
death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder  i did not 
pretend to enter into the merits of the case  yet i inclined towards 
the opinions of the hero  whose extinction i wept  without precisely 
understanding it  
 
   as i read  however  i applied much personally to my own feelings and 
condition  i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely 
unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i 
was a listener  i sympathised with and partly understood them  but i 
was unformed in mind  i was dependent on none and related to none  
   the path of my departure was free     and there was none to lament my 
annihilation  my person was hideous and my stature gigantic  what did 
this mean  who was i  what was i  whence did i come  what was my 
destination  these questions continually recurred  but i was unable to 
solve them  
 
   the volume of  plutarch   s lives  which i possessed contained the 
histories of the first founders of the ancient republics  this book 
had a far different effect upon me from the  sorrows of werter   i 
learned from werter   s imaginations despondency and gloom  but plutarch 
taught me high thoughts  he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my 
own reflections  to admire and love the heroes of past ages  many 
things i read surpassed my understanding and experience  i had a very 
confused knowledge of kingdoms  wide extents of country  mighty rivers  
and boundless seas  but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and 
large assemblages of men  the cottage of my protectors had been the 
only school in which i had studied human nature  but this book 
developed new and mightier scenes of action  i read of men concerned 
in public affairs  governing or massacring their species  i felt the 
greatest ardour for virtue rise within me  and abhorrence for vice  as 
far as i understood the signification of those terms  relative as they 
were  as i applied them  to pleasure and pain alone  induced by these 
feelings  i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers  numa  
solon  and lycurgus  in preference to romulus and theseus  the 
patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a 
firm hold on my mind  perhaps  if my first introduction to humanity had 
been made by a young soldier  burning for glory and slaughter  i should 
have been imbued with different sensations  
 
   but  paradise lost  excited different and far deeper emotions  i read 
it  as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands  as 
a true history  it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the 
picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of 
exciting  i often referred the several situations  as their similarity 
struck me  to my own  like adam  i was apparently united by no link to 
any other being in existence  but his state was far different from mine 
in every other respect  he had come forth from the hands of god a 
perfect creature  happy and prosperous  guarded by the especial care of 
his creator  he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from 
beings of a superior nature  but i was wretched  helpless  and alone  
many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition  for 
often  like him  when i viewed the bliss of my protectors  the bitter 
gall of envy rose within me  
 
   another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings  soon 
after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of 
the dress which i had taken from your laboratory  at first i had 
neglected them  but now that i was able to decipher the characters in 
which they were written  i began to study them with diligence  it was 
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation  you 
minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress 
of your work  this history was mingled with accounts of domestic 
occurrences  you doubtless recollect these papers  here they are  
everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed 
origin  the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances 
which produced it is set in view  the minutest description of my odious 
and loathsome person is given  in language which painted your own 
horrors and rendered mine indelible  i sickened as i read     hateful 
day when i received life     i exclaimed in agony     accursed creator  
why did you form a monster so hideous that even  you  turned from me in 
disgust  god  in pity  made man beautiful and alluring  after his own 
image  but my form is a filthy type of yours  more horrid even from the 
very resemblance  satan had his companions  fellow devils  to admire 
and encourage him  but i am solitary and abhorred     
 
   these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude  
but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers  their amiable and 
benevolent dispositions  i persuaded myself that when they should 
become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would 
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity  could they turn 
from their door one  however monstrous  who solicited their compassion 
and friendship  i resolved  at least  not to despair  but in every way 
to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate  i 
postponed this attempt for some months longer  for the importance 
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail  
besides  i found that my understanding improved so much with every 
day   s experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking 
until a few more months should have added to my sagacity  
 
   several changes  in the meantime  took place in the cottage  the 
presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants  and i also 
found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there  felix and agatha 
spent more time in amusement and conversation  and were assisted in 
their labours by servants  they did not appear rich  but they were 
contented and happy  their feelings were serene and peaceful  while 
mine became every day more tumultuous  increase of knowledge only 
discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was  i 
cherished hope  it is true  but it vanished when i beheld my person 
reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine  even as that frail 
image and that inconstant shade  
 
   i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial 
which in a few months i resolved to undergo  and sometimes i allowed my 
thoughts  unchecked by reason  to ramble in the fields of paradise  and 
dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my 
feelings and cheering my gloom  their angelic countenances breathed 
smiles of consolation  but it was all a dream  no eve soothed my 
sorrows nor shared my thoughts  i was alone  i remembered adam   s 
supplication to his creator  but where was mine  he had abandoned me  
and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him  
 
   autumn passed thus  i saw  with surprise and grief  the leaves decay 
and fall  and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it 
had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon  yet i did 
not heed the bleakness of the weather  i was better fitted by my 
conformation for the endurance of cold than heat  but my chief 
delights were the sight of the flowers  the birds  and all the gay 
apparel of summer  when those deserted me  i turned with more attention 
towards the cottagers  their happiness was not decreased by the 
absence of summer  they loved and sympathised with one another  and 
their joys  depending on each other  were not interrupted by the 
casualties that took place around them  the more i saw of them  the 
greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness  my 
heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures  to see 
their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost 
limit of my ambition  i dared not think that they would turn them from 
me with disdain and horror  the poor that stopped at their door were 
never driven away  i asked  it is true  for greater treasures than a 
little food or rest  i required kindness and sympathy  but i did not 
believe myself utterly unworthy of it  
 
   the winter advanced  and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken 
place since i awoke into life  my attention at this time was solely 
directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my 
protectors  i revolved many projects  but that on which i finally 
fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone  
i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my 
person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly 
beheld me  my voice  although harsh  had nothing terrible in it  i 
thought  therefore  that if in the absence of his children i could gain 
the good will and mediation of the old de lacey  i might by his means 
be tolerated by my younger protectors  
 
   one day  when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground 
and diffused cheerfulness  although it denied warmth  safie  agatha  
and felix departed on a long country walk  and the old man  at his own 
desire  was left alone in the cottage  when his children had departed  
he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs  more 
sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before  at first his 
countenance was illuminated with pleasure  but as he continued  
thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded  at length  laying aside the 
instrument  he sat absorbed in reflection  
 
   my heart beat quick  this was the hour and moment of trial  which 
would decide my hopes or realise my fears  the servants were gone to a 
neighbouring fair  all was silent in and around the cottage  it was an 
excellent opportunity  yet  when i proceeded to execute my plan  my 
limbs failed me and i sank to the ground  again i rose  and exerting 
all the firmness of which i was master  removed the planks which i had 
placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat  the fresh air revived 
me  and with renewed determination i approached the door of their 
cottage  
 
   i knocked     who is there     said the old man     come in     
 
   i entered     pardon this intrusion     said i     i am 
a traveller in want of a little rest  you would greatly oblige me if you 
would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire     
 
      enter     said de lacey     and i will try in what 
manner i can to relieve your wants  but  unfortunately  my children are 
from home  and as i am blind  i am afraid i shall find it difficult to 
procure food for you     
 
      do not trouble yourself  my kind host  i have food  it is 
warmth and rest only that i need     
 
   i sat down  and a silence ensued  i knew that every minute was 
precious to me  yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence 
the interview  when the old man addressed me  
 
   by your language  stranger  i suppose you are my countryman  are you 
french     
 
      no  but i was educated by a french family and understand that 
language only  i am now going to claim the protection of some friends  
whom i sincerely love  and of whose favour i have some hopes     
 
      are they germans     
 
      no  they are french  but let us change the subject  i am an 
unfortunate and deserted creature  i look around and i have no relation 
or friend upon earth  these amiable people to whom i go have never 
seen me and know little of me  i am full of fears  for if i fail 
there  i am an outcast in the world for ever     
 
      do not despair  to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate  but 
the hearts of men  when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest  are 
full of brotherly love and charity  rely  therefore  on your hopes  
and if these friends are good and amiable  do not despair     
 
      they are kind   they are the most excellent creatures in the world  
but  unfortunately  they are prejudiced against me  i have good 
dispositions  my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree 
beneficial  but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes  and where they 
ought to see a feeling and kind friend  they behold only a detestable 
monster     
 
      that is indeed unfortunate  but if you are really blameless  cannot 
you undeceive them     
 
      i am about to undertake that task  and it is on that account that i 
feel so many overwhelming terrors  i tenderly love these friends  i 
have  unknown to them  been for many months in the habits of daily 
kindness towards them  but they believe that i wish to injure them  and 
it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome     
 
      where do these friends reside     
 
      near this spot     
 
   the old man paused and then continued     if you will unreservedly 
confide to me the particulars of your tale  i perhaps may be of use in 
undeceiving them  i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance  but 
there is something in your words which persuades me that you are 
sincere  i am poor and an exile  but it will afford me true pleasure 
to be in any way serviceable to a human creature     
 
      excellent man  i thank you and accept your generous offer  you 
raise me from the dust by this kindness  and i trust that  by your aid  
i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow 
creatures     
 
      heaven forbid  even if you were really criminal  for that can only 
drive you to desperation  and not instigate you to virtue  i also am 
unfortunate  i and my family have been condemned  although innocent  
judge  therefore  if i do not feel for your misfortunes     
 
      how can i thank you  my best and only benefactor  from your lips 
first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me  i shall 
be for ever grateful  and your present humanity assures me of success 
with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting     
 
      may i know the names and residence of those friends     
 
   i paused  this  i thought  was the moment of decision  which was to 
rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever  i struggled vainly for 
firmness sufficient to answer him  but the effort destroyed all my 
remaining strength  i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud  at that 
moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors  i had not a moment 
to lose  but seizing the hand of the old man  i cried     now is the 
time  save and protect me  you and your family are the friends whom i 
seek  do not you desert me in the hour of trial     
 
      great god     exclaimed the old man     who are you     
 
   at that instant the cottage door was opened  and felix  safie  and 
agatha entered  who can describe their horror and consternation on 
beholding me  agatha fainted  and safie  unable to attend to her 
friend  rushed out of the cottage  felix darted forward  and with 
supernatural force tore me from his father  to whose knees i clung  in 
a transport of fury  he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently 
with a stick  i could have torn him limb from limb  as the lion rends 
the antelope  but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness  and 
i refrained  i saw him on the point of repeating his blow  when  
overcome by pain and anguish  i quitted the cottage  and in the general 
tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel     
 
 
 
 
chapter 16 
 
 
   cursed  cursed creator  why did i live  why  in that instant  did i 
not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly 
bestowed  i know not  despair had not yet taken possession of me  my 
feelings were those of rage and revenge  i could with pleasure have 
destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with 
their shrieks and misery  
 
   when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood  and 
now  no longer restrained by the fear of discovery  i gave vent to my 
anguish in fearful howlings  i was like a wild beast that had broken 
the toils  destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging 
through the wood with a stag-like swiftness  oh  what a miserable 
night i passed  the cold stars shone in mockery  and the bare trees 
waved their branches above me  now and then the sweet voice of a bird 
burst forth amidst the universal stillness  all  save i  were at rest 
or in enjoyment  i  like the arch-fiend  bore a hell within me  and 
finding myself unsympathised with  wished to tear up the trees  spread 
havoc and destruction around me  and then to have sat down and enjoyed 
the ruin  
 
   but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure  i became 
fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in 
the sick impotence of despair  there was none among the myriads of men 
that existed who would pity or assist me  and should i feel kindness 
towards my enemies  no  from that moment i declared everlasting war 
against the species  and more than all  against him who had formed me 
and sent me forth to this insupportable misery  
 
   the sun rose  i heard the voices of men and knew that it was 
impossible to return to my retreat during that day  accordingly i hid 
myself in some thick underwood  determining to devote the ensuing hours 
to reflection on my situation  
 
   the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some 
degree of tranquillity  and when i considered what had passed at the 
cottage  i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my 
conclusions  i had certainly acted imprudently  it was apparent that 
my conversation had interested the father in my behalf  and i was a 
fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children  i 
ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me  and by degrees to 
have discovered myself to the rest of his family  when they should have 
been prepared for my approach  but i did not believe my errors to be 
irretrievable  and after much consideration i resolved to return to the 
cottage  seek the old man  and by my representations win him to my 
party  
 
   these thoughts calmed me  and in the afternoon i sank into a profound 
sleep  but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by 
peaceful dreams  the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever 
acting before my eyes  the females were flying and the enraged felix 
tearing me from his father   s feet  i awoke exhausted  and finding that 
it was already night  i crept forth from my hiding-place  and went in 
search of food  
 
   when my hunger was appeased  i directed my steps towards the 
well-known path that conducted to the cottage  all there was at peace  
i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the 
accustomed hour when the family arose  that hour passed  the sun 
mounted high in the heavens  but the cottagers did not appear  i 
trembled violently  apprehending some dreadful misfortune  the inside 
of the cottage was dark  and i heard no motion  i cannot describe the 
agony of this suspense  
 
   presently two countrymen passed by  but pausing near the cottage  they 
entered into conversation  using violent gesticulations  but i did not 
understand what they said  as they spoke the language of the country  
which differed from that of my protectors  soon after  however  felix 
approached with another man  i was surprised  as i knew that he had not 
quitted the cottage that morning  and waited anxiously to discover from 
his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances  
 
      do you consider     said his companion to him  
   that you will be obliged to pay three months    rent and to lose 
the produce of your garden  i do not wish to take any unfair advantage  and 
i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your 
determination     
 
      it is utterly useless     replied felix     we can 
never again inhabit your cottage  the life of my father is in the greatest 
danger  owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related  my wife and 
my sister will never recover from their horror  i entreat you not to reason 
with me any more  take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this 
place     
 
   felix trembled violently as he said this  he and his companion 
entered the cottage  in which they remained for a few minutes  and then 
departed  i never saw any of the family of de lacey more  
 
   i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of 
utter and stupid despair  my protectors had departed and had broken 
the only link that held me to the world  for the first time the 
feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom  and i did not strive to 
control them  but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream  i 
bent my mind towards injury and death  when i thought of my friends  
of the mild voice of de lacey  the gentle eyes of agatha  and the 
exquisite beauty of the arabian  these thoughts vanished and a gush of 
tears somewhat soothed me  but again when i reflected that they had 
spurned and deserted me  anger returned  a rage of anger  and unable to 
injure anything human  i turned my fury towards inanimate objects  as 
night advanced  i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage  
and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden  
i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my 
operations  
 
   as the night advanced  a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly 
dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens  the blast tore 
along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my 
spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection  i lighted the 
dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage  
my eyes still fixed on the western horizon  the edge of which the moon 
nearly touched  a part of its orb was at length hid  and i waved my 
brand  it sank  and with a loud scream i fired the straw  and heath  
and bushes  which i had collected  the wind fanned the fire  and the 
cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames  which clung to it and 
licked it with their forked and destroying tongues  
 
   as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of 
the habitation  i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods  
 
   and now  with the world before me  whither should i bend my steps  i 
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes  but to me  hated 
and despised  every country must be equally horrible  at length the 
thought of you crossed my mind  i learned from your papers that you 
were my father  my creator  and to whom could i apply with more fitness 
than to him who had given me life  among the lessons that felix had 
bestowed upon safie  geography had not been omitted  i had learned from 
these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth  
you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town  and towards 
this place i resolved to proceed  
 
   but how was i to direct myself  i knew that i must travel in a 
southwesterly direction to reach my destination  but the sun was my 
only guide  i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass 
through  nor could i ask information from a single human being  but i 
did not despair  from you only could i hope for succour  although 
towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred  unfeeling  
heartless creator  you had endowed me with perceptions and passions 
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind  
but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress  and from you i 
determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from 
any other being that wore the human form  
 
   my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense  it was 
late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided  
i travelled only at night  fearful of encountering the visage of a 
human being  nature decayed around me  and the sun became heatless  
rain and snow poured around me  mighty rivers were frozen  the surface 
of the earth was hard and chill  and bare  and i found no shelter  oh  
earth  how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being  the 
mildness of my nature had fled  and all within me was turned to gall 
and bitterness  the nearer i approached to your habitation  the more 
deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart  snow 
fell  and the waters were hardened  but i rested not  a few incidents 
now and then directed me  and i possessed a map of the country  but i 
often wandered wide from my path  the agony of my feelings allowed me 
no respite  no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could 
not extract its food  but a circumstance that happened when i arrived 
on the confines of switzerland  when the sun had recovered its warmth 
and the earth again began to look green  confirmed in an especial 
manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings  
 
   i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was 
secured by night from the view of man  one morning  however  finding 
that my path lay through a deep wood  i ventured to continue my journey 
after the sun had risen  the day  which was one of the first of spring  
cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of 
the air  i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure  that had long 
appeared dead  revive within me  half surprised by the novelty of 
these sensations  i allowed myself to be borne away by them  and 
forgetting my solitude and deformity  dared to be happy  soft tears 
again bedewed my cheeks  and i even raised my humid eyes with 
thankfulness towards the blessed sun  which bestowed such joy upon me  
 
   i continued to wind among the paths of the wood  until i came to its 
boundary  which was skirted by a deep and rapid river  into which many 
of the trees bent their branches  now budding with the fresh spring  
here i paused  not exactly knowing what path to pursue  when i heard 
the sound of voices  that induced me to conceal myself under the shade 
of a cypress  i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running 
towards the spot where i was concealed  laughing  as if she ran from 
someone in sport  she continued her course along the precipitous sides 
of the river  when suddenly her foot slipped  and she fell into the 
rapid stream  i rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour  
from the force of the current  saved her and dragged her to shore  she 
was senseless  and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore 
animation  when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic  
who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled  on 
seeing me  he darted towards me  and tearing the girl from my arms  
hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood  i followed speedily  i 
hardly knew why  but when the man saw me draw near  he aimed a gun  
which he carried  at my body and fired  i sank to the ground  and my 
injurer  with increased swiftness  escaped into the wood  
 
   this was then the reward of my benevolence  i had saved a human being 
from destruction  and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable 
pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone  the feelings of 
kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments 
before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth  inflamed by 
pain  i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind  but the 
agony of my wound overcame me  my pulses paused  and i fainted  
 
   for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods  endeavouring to 
cure the wound which i had received  the ball had entered my shoulder  
and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through  at any 
rate i had no means of extracting it  my sufferings were augmented 
also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their 
infliction  my daily vows rose for revenge   a deep and deadly revenge  
such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had 
endured  
 
   after some weeks my wound healed  and i continued my journey  the 
labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or 
gentle breezes of spring  all joy was but a mockery which insulted my 
desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for 
the enjoyment of pleasure  
 
   but my toils now drew near a close  and in two months from this time i 
reached the environs of geneva  
 
   it was evening when i arrived  and i retired to a hiding-place among 
the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply 
to you  i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to 
enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting 
behind the stupendous mountains of jura  
 
   at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection  
which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child  who came 
running into the recess i had chosen  with all the sportiveness of 
infancy  suddenly  as i gazed on him  an idea seized me that this 
little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have 
imbibed a horror of deformity  if  therefore  i could seize him and 
educate him as my companion and friend  i should not be so desolate in 
this peopled earth  
 
   urged by this impulse  i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him 
towards me  as soon as he beheld my form  he placed his hands before 
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream  i drew his hand forcibly from his 
face and said     child  what is the meaning of this  i do not intend to 
hurt you  listen to me     
 
   he struggled violently     let me go     he cried  
   monster  ugly wretch  you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces  you 
are an ogre  let me go  or i will tell my papa     
 
      boy  you will never see your father again  you must come with me     
 
      hideous monster  let me go  my papa is a syndic   he is m  
frankenstein   he will punish you  you dare not keep me     
 
      frankenstein  you belong then to my enemy   to him towards whom i have 
sworn eternal revenge  you shall be my first victim     
 
   the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried 
despair to my heart  i grasped his throat to silence him  and in a 
moment he lay dead at my feet  
 
   i gazed on my victim  and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish 
triumph  clapping my hands  i exclaimed     i too can create desolation  
my enemy is not invulnerable  this death will carry despair to him  and 
a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him     
 
   as i fixed my eyes on the child  i saw something glittering on his 
breast  i took it  it was a portrait of a most lovely woman  in spite 
of my malignity  it softened and attracted me  for a few moments i 
gazed with delight on her dark eyes  fringed by deep lashes  and her 
lovely lips  but presently my rage returned  i remembered that i was 
for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could 
bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would  in 
regarding me  have changed that air of divine benignity to one 
expressive of disgust and affright  
 
   can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage  i only 
wonder that at that moment  instead of venting my sensations in 
exclamations and agony  i did not rush among mankind and perish in the 
attempt to destroy them  
 
   while i was overcome by these feelings  i left the spot where i had 
committed the murder  and seeking a more secluded hiding-place  i 
entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty  a woman was 
sleeping on some straw  she was young  not indeed so beautiful as her 
whose portrait i held  but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the 
loveliness of youth and health  here  i thought  is one of those whose 
joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me  and then i bent over 
her and whispered     awake  fairest  thy lover is near   he who would 
give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes  my 
beloved  awake     
 
   the sleeper stirred  a thrill of terror ran through me  should she 
indeed awake  and see me  and curse me  and denounce the murderer  thus 
would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me  
the thought was madness  it stirred the fiend within me   not i  but 
she  shall suffer  the murder i have committed because i am for ever 
robbed of all that she could give me  she shall atone  the crime had 
its source in her  be hers the punishment  thanks to the lessons of 
felix and the sanguinary laws of man  i had learned now to work 
mischief  i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of 
the folds of her dress  she moved again  and i fled  
 
   for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place  
sometimes wishing to see you  sometimes resolved to quit the world and 
its miseries for ever  at length i wandered towards these mountains  
and have ranged through their immense recesses  consumed by a burning 
passion which you alone can gratify  we may not part until you have 
promised to comply with my requisition  i am alone and miserable  man 
will not associate with me  but one as deformed and horrible as myself 
would not deny herself to me  my companion must be of the same species 
and have the same defects  this being you must create     
 
 
 
 
chapter 17 
 
 
the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the 
expectation of a reply  but i was bewildered  perplexed  and unable to 
arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his 
proposition  he continued  
 
   you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the 
interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being  this you alone 
can do  and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to 
concede     
 
the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had 
died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers  and 
as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within 
me  
 
   i do refuse it     i replied     and no torture shall ever extort a 
consent from me  you may render me the most miserable of men  but you 
shall never make me base in my own eyes  shall i create another like 
yourself  whose joint wickedness might desolate the world  begone  i 
have answered you  you may torture me  but i will never consent     
 
   you are in the wrong     replied the fiend     and instead 
of threatening  i am content to reason with you  i am malicious because i 
am miserable  am i not shunned and hated by all mankind  you  my creator  
would tear me to pieces and triumph  remember that  and tell me why i 
should pity man more than he pities me  you would not call it murder if you 
could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame  the 
work of your own hands  shall i respect man when he condemns me  let him 
live with me in the interchange of kindness  and instead of injury i would 
bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance  
but that cannot be  the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our 
union  yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery  i will 
revenge my injuries  if i cannot inspire love  i will cause fear  and 
chiefly towards you my arch-enemy  because my creator  do i swear 
inextinguishable hatred  have a care  i will work at your destruction  nor 
finish until i desolate your heart  so that you shall curse the hour of 
your birth     
 
a fiendish rage animated him as he said this  his face was wrinkled 
into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold  but presently 
he calmed himself and proceeded    
 
   i intended to reason  this passion is detrimental to me  for you do 
not reflect that  you  are the cause of its excess  if any being felt 
emotions of benevolence towards me  i should return them a hundred and a 
hundredfold  for that one creature   s sake i would make peace with the 
whole kind  but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised  
what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate  i demand a creature of 
another sex  but as hideous as myself  the gratification is small  but it 
is all that i can receive  and it shall content me  it is true  we shall be 
monsters  cut off from all the world  but on that account we shall be more 
attached to one another  our lives will not be happy  but they will be 
harmless and free from the misery i now feel  oh  my creator  make me 
happy  let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit  let me see that i 
excite the sympathy of some existing thing  do not deny me my 
request     
 
i was moved  i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences 
of my consent  but i felt that there was some justice in his argument  
his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature 
of fine sensations  and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion 
of happiness that it was in my power to bestow  he saw my change of 
feeling and continued  
 
   if you consent  neither you nor any other human being shall ever see 
us again  i will go to the vast wilds of south america  my food is not 
that of man  i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite  
acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment  my companion will 
be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare  
we shall make our bed of dried leaves  the sun will shine on us as on 
man and will ripen our food  the picture i present to you is peaceful 
and human  and you must feel that you could deny it only in the 
wantonness of power and cruelty  pitiless as you have been towards me  
i now see compassion in your eyes  let me seize the favourable moment 
and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire     
 
   you propose     replied i     to fly from the habitations of 
man  to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your 
only companions  how can you  who long for the love and sympathy of man  
persevere in this exile  you will return and again seek their kindness  and 
you will meet with their detestation  your evil passions will be renewed  
and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction  
this may not be  cease to argue the point  for i cannot consent     
 
   how inconstant are your feelings  but a moment ago you were moved by 
my representations  and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints  
i swear to you  by the earth which i inhabit  and by you that made me  that 
with the companion you bestow  i will quit the neighbourhood of man and 
dwell  as it may chance  in the most savage of places  my evil passions 
will have fled  for i shall meet with sympathy  my life will flow quietly 
away  and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker     
 
his words had a strange effect upon me  i compassionated him and 
sometimes felt a wish to console him  but when i looked upon him  when 
i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked  my heart sickened and my 
feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred  i tried to stifle 
these sensations  i thought that as i could not sympathise with him  i 
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which 
was yet in my power to bestow  
 
   you swear     i said     to be harmless  but have you not 
already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust 
you  may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by 
affording a wider scope for your revenge     
 
   how is this  i must not be trifled with  and i demand an answer  if 
i have no ties and no affections  hatred and vice must be my portion  
the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes  and i shall 
become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant  my vices 
are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor  and my virtues will 
necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal  i shall feel 
the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of 
existence and events from which i am now excluded     
 
i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various 
arguments which he had employed  i thought of the promise of virtues which 
he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight 
of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had 
manifested towards him  his power and threats were not omitted in my 
calculations  a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers 
and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices 
was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with  after a 
long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and 
my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request  
turning to him  therefore  i said  
 
   i consent to your demand  on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever  
and every other place in the neighbourhood of man  as soon as i shall 
deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile     
 
   i swear     he cried     by the sun  and by the blue sky of 
heaven  and by the fire of love that burns my heart  that if you grant my 
prayer  while they exist you shall never behold me again  depart to your 
home and commence your labours  i shall watch their progress with 
unutterable anxiety  and fear not but that when you are ready i shall 
appear     
 
saying this  he suddenly quitted me  fearful  perhaps  of any change in 
my sentiments  i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than 
the flight of an eagle  and quickly lost among the undulations of the 
sea of ice  
 
his tale had occupied the whole day  and the sun was upon the verge of 
the horizon when he departed  i knew that i ought to hasten my descent 
towards the valley  as i should soon be encompassed in darkness  but my 
heart was heavy  and my steps slow  the labour of winding among the 
little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced 
perplexed me  occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences 
of the day had produced  night was far advanced when i came to the 
halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain  the stars 
shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them  the dark pines 
rose before me  and every here and there a broken tree lay on the 
ground  it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange 
thoughts within me  i wept bitterly  and clasping my hands in agony  i 
exclaimed     oh  stars and clouds and winds  ye are all about to mock 
me  if ye really pity me  crush sensation and memory  let me become as 
nought  but if not  depart  depart  and leave me in darkness     
 
these were wild and miserable thoughts  but i cannot describe to you 
how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i 
listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its 
way to consume me  
 
morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix  i took no 
rest  but returned immediately to geneva  even in my own heart i could 
give no expression to my sensations   they weighed on me with a 
mountain   s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them  
thus i returned home  and entering the house  presented myself to the 
family  my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm  but i 
answered no question  scarcely did i speak  i felt as if i were placed 
under a ban   as if i had no right to claim their sympathies   as if 
never more might i enjoy companionship with them  yet even thus i 
loved them to adoration  and to save them  i resolved to dedicate 
myself to my most abhorred task  the prospect of such an occupation 
made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream  
and that thought only had to me the reality of life  
 
 
 
 
chapter 18 
 
 
day after day  week after week  passed away on my return to geneva  and 
i could not collect the courage to recommence my work  i feared the 
vengeance of the disappointed fiend  yet i was unable to overcome my 
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me  i found that i could not 
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound 
study and laborious disquisition  i had heard of some discoveries 
having been made by an english philosopher  the knowledge of which was 
material to my success  and i sometimes thought of obtaining my 
father   s consent to visit england for this purpose  but i clung to 
every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an 
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to 
me  a change indeed had taken place in me  my health  which had 
hitherto declined  was now much restored  and my spirits  when 
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise  rose proportionably  my 
father saw this change with pleasure  and he turned his thoughts 
towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy  
which every now and then would return by fits  and with a devouring 
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine  at these moments i took 
refuge in the most perfect solitude  i passed whole days on the lake 
alone in a little boat  watching the clouds and listening to the 
rippling of the waves  silent and listless  but the fresh air and 
bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure  and 
on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile 
and a more cheerful heart  
 
it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father  
calling me aside  thus addressed me  
 
   i am happy to remark  my dear son  that you have resumed your former 
pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself  and yet you are still 
unhappy and still avoid our society  for some time i was lost in 
conjecture as to the cause of this  but yesterday an idea struck me  
and if it is well founded  i conjure you to avow it  reserve on such a 
point would be not only useless  but draw down treble misery on us all     
 
i trembled violently at his exordium  and my father continued    
 
   i confess  my son  that i have always looked forward to your 
marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the 
stay of my declining years  you were attached to each other from your 
earliest infancy  you studied together  and appeared  in dispositions and 
tastes  entirely suited to one another  but so blind is the experience of 
man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have 
entirely destroyed it  you  perhaps  regard her as your sister  without any 
wish that she might become your wife  nay  you may have met with another 
whom you may love  and considering yourself as bound in honour to 
elizabeth  this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear 
to feel     
 
   my dear father  reassure yourself  i love my cousin tenderly and 
sincerely  i never saw any woman who excited  as elizabeth does  my 
warmest admiration and affection  my future hopes and prospects are 
entirely bound up in the expectation of our union     
 
   the expression of your sentiments of this subject  my dear victor  
gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced  if you 
feel thus  we shall assuredly be happy  however present events may cast 
a gloom over us  but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so 
strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate  tell me  
therefore  whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the 
marriage  we have been unfortunate  and recent events have drawn us 
from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities  you 
are younger  yet i do not suppose  possessed as you are of a competent 
fortune  that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future 
plans of honour and utility that you may have formed  do not suppose  
however  that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on 
your part would cause me any serious uneasiness  interpret my words 
with candour and answer me  i conjure you  with confidence and 
sincerity     
 
i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable 
of offering any reply  i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of 
thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion  alas  to me 
the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and 
dismay  i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled 
and dared not break  or if i did  what manifold miseries might not 
impend over me and my devoted family  could i enter into a festival 
with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the 
ground  i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with 
his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from 
which i expected peace  
 
i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to 
england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers 
of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable 
use to me in my present undertaking  the latter method of obtaining 
the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory  besides  i 
had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my 
loathsome task in my father   s house while in habits of familiar 
intercourse with those i loved  i knew that a thousand fearful 
accidents might occur  the slightest of which would disclose a tale to 
thrill all connected with me with horror  i was aware also that i 
should often lose all self-command  all capacity of hiding the 
harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my 
unearthly occupation  i must absent myself from all i loved while thus 
employed  once commenced  it would quickly be achieved  and i might be 
restored to my family in peace and happiness  my promise fulfilled  
the monster would depart for ever  or  so my fond fancy imaged  some 
accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my 
slavery for ever  
 
these feelings dictated my answer to my father  i expressed a wish to 
visit england  but concealing the true reasons of this request  i 
clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion  while i 
urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to 
comply  after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that 
resembled madness in its intensity and effects  he was glad to find 
that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey  
and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would  before my 
return  have restored me entirely to myself  
 
the duration of my absence was left to my own choice  a few months  or 
at most a year  was the period contemplated  one paternal kind 
precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion  without 
previously communicating with me  he had  in concert with elizabeth  
arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh  this interfered 
with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task  yet at the 
commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be 
an impediment  and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many 
hours of lonely  maddening reflection  nay  henry might stand between 
me and the intrusion of my foe  if i were alone  would he not at times 
force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to 
contemplate its progress  
 
to england  therefore  i was bound  and it was understood that my union 
with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return  my father   s 
age rendered him extremely averse to delay  for myself  there was one 
reward i promised myself from my detested toils   one consolation for my 
unparalleled sufferings  it was the prospect of that day when  
enfranchised from my miserable slavery  i might claim elizabeth and 
forget the past in my union with her  
 
i now made arrangements for my journey  but one feeling haunted me 
which filled me with fear and agitation  during my absence i should 
leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and 
unprotected from his attacks  exasperated as he might be by my 
departure  but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go  and 
would he not accompany me to england  this imagination was dreadful in 
itself  but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends  
i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of 
this might happen  but through the whole period during which i was the 
slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of 
the moment  and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend 
would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his 
machinations  
 
it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native 
country  my journey had been my own suggestion  and elizabeth 
therefore acquiesced  but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of 
my suffering  away from her  the inroads of misery and grief  it had 
been her care which provided me a companion in clerval   and yet a man 
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman   s 
sedulous attention  she longed to bid me hasten my return  a thousand 
conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful  silent 
farewell  
 
i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away  hardly 
knowing whither i was going  and careless of what was passing around  
i remembered only  and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on 
it  to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with 
me  filled with dreary imaginations  i passed through many beautiful 
and majestic scenes  but my eyes were fixed and unobserving  i could 
only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy 
me whilst they endured  
 
after some days spent in listless indolence  during which i traversed 
many leagues  i arrived at strasburgh  where i waited two days for 
clerval  he came  alas  how great was the contrast between us  he 
was alive to every new scene  joyful when he saw the beauties of the 
setting sun  and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new 
day  he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and 
the appearances of the sky     this is what it is to live     he cried  
   now i enjoy existence  but you  my dear frankenstein  wherefore are 
you desponding and sorrowful     in truth  i was occupied by gloomy 
thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden 
sunrise reflected in the rhine  and you  my friend  would be far more 
amused with the journal of clerval  who observed the scenery with an 
eye of feeling and delight  than in listening to my reflections  i  a 
miserable wretch  haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to 
enjoyment  
 
we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to 
rotterdam  whence we might take shipping for london  during this 
voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns  
we stayed a day at mannheim  and on the fifth from our departure from 
strasburgh  arrived at mainz  the course of the rhine below mainz 
becomes much more picturesque  the river descends rapidly and winds 
between hills  not high  but steep  and of beautiful forms  we saw 
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices  surrounded by 
black woods  high and inaccessible  this part of the rhine  indeed  
presents a singularly variegated landscape  in one spot you view 
rugged hills  ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices  with 
the dark rhine rushing beneath  and on the sudden turn of a promontory  
flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river 
and populous towns occupy the scene  
 
we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers 
as we glided down the stream  even i  depressed in mind  and my spirits 
continually agitated by gloomy feelings  even i was pleased  i lay at the 
bottom of the boat  and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky  i seemed to 
drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger  and if these 
were my sensations  who can describe those of henry  he felt as if he had 
been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by 
man     i have seen     he said     the most beautiful scenes 
of my own country  i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri  where the 
snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water  casting black 
and impenetrable shades  which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance 
were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay 
appearance  i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest  when the wind tore 
up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be 
on the great ocean  and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain  
where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and 
where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the 
nightly wind  i have seen the mountains of la valais  and the pays de vaud  
but this country  victor  pleases me more than all those wonders  the 
mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange  but there is a 
charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled  
look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice  and that also on the 
island  almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees  and now 
that group of labourers coming from among their vines  and that village 
half hid in the recess of the mountain  oh  surely the spirit that inhabits 
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who 
pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of 
our own country     
 
clerval  beloved friend  even now it delights me to record your words and 
to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving  he was a 
being formed in the    very poetry of nature     his wild and 
enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart  his 
soul overflowed with ardent affections  and his friendship was of that 
devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only 
in the imagination  but even human sympathies were not sufficient to 
satisfy his eager mind  the scenery of external nature  which others regard 
only with admiration  he loved with ardour     
 
          the sounding cataract 
    haunted him like a passion  the tall rock  
    the mountain  and the deep and gloomy wood  
    their colours and their forms  were then to him 
    an appetite  a feeling  and a love  
    that had no need of a remoter charm  
    by thought supplied  or any interest 
    unborrow   d from the eye  
 
           wordsworth   s    tintern abbey      
 
and where does he now exist  is this gentle and lovely being lost 
for ever  has this mind  so replete with ideas  imaginations fanciful 
and magnificent  which formed a world  whose existence depended on the 
life of its creator    has this mind perished  does it now only exist 
in my memory  no  it is not thus  your form so divinely wrought  and 
beaming with beauty  has decayed  but your spirit still visits and 
consoles your unhappy friend  
 
pardon this gush of sorrow  these ineffectual words are but a slight 
tribute to the unexampled worth of henry  but they soothe my heart  
overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates  i will 
proceed with my tale  
 
beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland  and we resolved to 
post the remainder of our way  for the wind was contrary and the stream of 
the river was too gentle to aid us  
 
our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery  but we 
arrived in a few days at rotterdam  whence we proceeded by sea to england  
it was on a clear morning  in the latter days of december  that i first saw 
the white cliffs of britain  the banks of the thames presented a new scene  
they were flat but fertile  and almost every town was marked by the 
remembrance of some story  we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish 
armada  gravesend  woolwich  and greenwich   places which i had heard 
of even in my country  
 
at length we saw the numerous steeples of london  st  paul   s towering 
above all  and the tower famed in english history  
 
 
 
 
chapter 19 
 
 
london was our present point of rest  we determined to remain several 
months in this wonderful and celebrated city  clerval desired the 
intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this 
time  but this was with me a secondary object  i was principally 
occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the 
completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of 
introduction that i had brought with me  addressed to the most 
distinguished natural philosophers  
 
if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness  
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure  but a blight had 
come over my existence  and i only visited these people for the sake of 
the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest 
was so terribly profound  company was irksome to me  when alone  i 
could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth  the voice of 
henry soothed me  and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory 
peace  but busy  uninteresting  joyous faces brought back despair to 
my heart  i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my 
fellow men  this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and 
justine  and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled 
my soul with anguish  
 
but in clerval i saw the image of my former self  he was inquisitive 
and anxious to gain experience and instruction  the difference of 
manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of 
instruction and amusement  he was also pursuing an object he had long 
had in view  his design was to visit india  in the belief that he had 
in his knowledge of its various languages  and in the views he had 
taken of its society  the means of materially assisting the progress of 
european colonization and trade  in britain only could he further the 
execution of his plan  he was for ever busy  and the only check to his 
enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind  i tried to conceal this 
as much as possible  that i might not debar him from the pleasures 
natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life  undisturbed by 
any care or bitter recollection  i often refused to accompany him  
alleging another engagement  that i might remain alone  i now also 
began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation  and this 
was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling 
on the head  every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme 
anguish  and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips 
to quiver  and my heart to palpitate  
 
after passing some months in london  we received a letter from a person in 
scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva  he mentioned the 
beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient 
allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth  
where he resided  clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation  and i  
although i abhorred society  wished to view again mountains and streams and 
all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places  
 
we had arrived in england at the beginning of october  and it was now 
february  we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the 
north at the expiration of another month  in this expedition we did not 
intend to follow the great road to edinburgh  but to visit windsor  oxford  
matlock  and the cumberland lakes  resolving to arrive at the completion of 
this tour about the end of july  i packed up my chemical instruments and 
the materials i had collected  resolving to finish my labours in some 
obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland  
 
we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at 
windsor  rambling in its beautiful forest  this was a new scene to us 
mountaineers  the majestic oaks  the quantity of game  and the herds of 
stately deer were all novelties to us  
 
from thence we proceeded to oxford  as we entered this city  our minds 
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted 
there more than a century and a half before  it was here that charles 
i  had collected his forces  this city had remained faithful to him  
after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of 
parliament and liberty  the memory of that unfortunate king and his 
companions  the amiable falkland  the insolent goring  his queen  and 
son  gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they 
might be supposed to have inhabited  the spirit of elder days found a 
dwelling here  and we delighted to trace its footsteps  if these 
feelings had not found an imaginary gratification  the appearance of 
the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration  
the colleges are ancient and picturesque  the streets are almost 
magnificent  and the lovely isis  which flows beside it through meadows 
of exquisite verdure  is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters  
which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers  and spires  and 
domes  embosomed among aged trees  
 
i enjoyed this scene  and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the 
memory of the past and the anticipation of the future  i was formed 
for peaceful happiness  during my youthful days discontent never 
visited my mind  and if i was ever overcome by  ennui   the sight of what 
is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in 
the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate 
elasticity to my spirits  but i am a blasted tree  the bolt has 
entered my soul  and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what 
i shall soon cease to be   a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity  
pitiable to others and intolerable to myself  
 
we passed a considerable period at oxford  rambling among its environs 
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most 
animating epoch of english history  our little voyages of discovery 
were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented 
themselves  we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the 
field on which that patriot fell  for a moment my soul was elevated 
from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas 
of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments 
and the remembrancers  for an instant i dared to shake off my chains 
and look around me with a free and lofty spirit  but the iron had eaten 
into my flesh  and i sank again  trembling and hopeless  into my 
miserable self  
 
we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock  which was our next 
place of rest  the country in the neighbourhood of this village 
resembled  to a greater degree  the scenery of switzerland  but 
everything is on a lower scale  and the green hills want the crown of 
distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my 
native country  we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets 
of natural history  where the curiosities are disposed in the same 
manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix  the latter name 
made me tremble when pronounced by henry  and i hastened to quit 
matlock  with which that terrible scene was thus associated  
 
from derby  still journeying northwards  we passed two months in 
cumberland and westmorland  i could now almost fancy myself among the 
swiss mountains  the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the 
northern sides of the mountains  the lakes  and the dashing of the 
rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me  here also we 
made some acquaintances  who almost contrived to cheat me into 
happiness  the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than 
mine  his mind expanded in the company of men of talent  and he found 
in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have 
imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his 
inferiors     i could pass my life here     said he to me     and among 
these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine     
 
but he found that a traveller   s life is one that includes much pain 
amidst its enjoyments  his feelings are for ever on the stretch  and 
when he begins to sink into repose  he finds himself obliged to quit 
that on which he rests in pleasure for something new  which again 
engages his attention  and which also he forsakes for other novelties  
 
we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland 
and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period 
of our appointment with our scotch friend approached  and we left them 
to travel on  for my own part i was not sorry  i had now neglected my 
promise for some time  and i feared the effects of the d  mon   s 
disappointment  he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance 
on my relatives  this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment 
from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace  i waited 
for my letters with feverish impatience  if they were delayed i was 
miserable and overcome by a thousand fears  and when they arrived and i 
saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father  i hardly dared to 
read and ascertain my fate  sometimes i thought that the fiend 
followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion  
when these thoughts possessed me  i would not quit henry for a moment  
but followed him as his shadow  to protect him from the fancied rage of 
his destroyer  i felt as if i had committed some great crime  the 
consciousness of which haunted me  i was guiltless  but i had indeed 
drawn down a horrible curse upon my head  as mortal as that of crime  
 
i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind  and yet that city might 
have interested the most unfortunate being  clerval did not like it so well 
as oxford  for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him  
but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh  its romantic 
castle and its environs  the most delightful in the world  arthur   s 
seat  st  bernard   s well  and the pentland hills  compensated him for 
the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration  but i was 
impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey  
 
we left edinburgh in a week  passing through coupar  st  andrew   s  and 
along the banks of the tay  to perth  where our friend expected us  
but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into 
their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest  and 
accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland 
alone     do you     said i     enjoy yourself  and let this be our 
rendezvous  i may be absent a month or two  but do not interfere with 
my motions  i entreat you  leave me to peace and solitude for a short 
time  and when i return  i hope it will be with a lighter heart  more 
congenial to your own temper     
 
henry wished to dissuade me  but seeing me bent on this plan  ceased to 
remonstrate  he entreated me to write often     i had rather be with 
you     he said     in your solitary rambles  than with these scotch 
people  whom i do not know  hasten  then  my dear friend  to return  
that i may again feel myself somewhat at home  which i cannot do in 
your absence     
 
having parted from my friend  i determined to visit some remote spot of 
scotland and finish my work in solitude  i did not doubt but that the 
monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have 
finished  that he might receive his companion  
 
with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of 
the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours  it was a place 
fitted for such a work  being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were 
continually beaten upon by the waves  the soil was barren  scarcely 
affording pasture for a few miserable cows  and oatmeal for its 
inhabitants  which consisted of five persons  whose gaunt and scraggy limbs 
gave tokens of their miserable fare  vegetables and bread  when they 
indulged in such luxuries  and even fresh water  was to be procured from 
the mainland  which was about five miles distant  
 
on the whole island there were but three miserable huts  and one of 
these was vacant when i arrived  this i hired  it contained but two 
rooms  and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable 
penury  the thatch had fallen in  the walls were unplastered  and the 
door was off its hinges  i ordered it to be repaired  bought some 
furniture  and took possession  an incident which would doubtless have 
occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been 
benumbed by want and squalid poverty  as it was  i lived ungazed at 
and unmolested  hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes 
which i gave  so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations 
of men  
 
in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour  but in the evening  
when the weather permitted  i walked on the stony beach of the sea to 
listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet  it was a 
monotonous yet ever-changing scene  i thought of switzerland  it was 
far different from this desolate and appalling landscape  its hills 
are covered with vines  and its cottages are scattered thickly in the 
plains  its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky  and when 
troubled by the winds  their tumult is but as the play of a lively 
infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean  
 
in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived  but 
as i proceeded in my labour  it became every day more horrible and 
irksome to me  sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my 
laboratory for several days  and at other times i toiled day and night 
in order to complete my work  it was  indeed  a filthy process in 
which i was engaged  during my first experiment  a kind of 
enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment  my 
mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour  and my eyes 
were shut to the horror of my proceedings  but now i went to it in 
cold blood  and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands  
 
thus situated  employed in the most detestable occupation  immersed in 
a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from 
the actual scene in which i was engaged  my spirits became unequal  i 
grew restless and nervous  every moment i feared to meet my 
persecutor  sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground  fearing 
to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much 
dreaded to behold  i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow 
creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion  
 
in the mean time i worked on  and my labour was already considerably 
advanced  i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager 
hope  which i dared not trust myself to question but which was 
intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken 
in my bosom  
 
 
 
 
chapter 20 
 
 
i sat one evening in my laboratory  the sun had set  and the moon was just 
rising from the sea  i had not sufficient light for my employment  and i 
remained idle  in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my 
labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention 
to it  as i sat  a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to 
consider the effects of what i was now doing  three years before  i was 
engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled 
barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest 
remorse  i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was 
alike ignorant  she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her 
mate and delight  for its own sake  in murder and wretchedness  he had 
sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts  but she 
had not  and she  who in all probability was to become a thinking and 
reasoning animal  might refuse to comply with a compact made before her 
creation  they might even hate each other  the creature who already lived 
loathed his own deformity  and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence 
for it when it came before his eyes in the female form  she also might turn 
with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man  she might quit him  
and he be again alone  exasperated by the fresh provocation of being 
deserted by one of his own species  
 
even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world  
yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d  mon 
thirsted would be children  and a race of devils would be propagated upon 
the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a 
condition precarious and full of terror  had i right  for my own benefit  
to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations  i had before been moved 
by the sophisms of the being i had created  i had been struck senseless by 
his fiendish threats  but now  for the first time  the wickedness of my 
promise burst upon me  i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me 
as their pest  whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at 
the price  perhaps  of the existence of the whole human race  
 
i trembled and my heart failed within me  when  on looking up  i saw by 
the light of the moon the d  mon at the casement  a ghastly grin 
wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me  where i sat fulfilling the task 
which he had allotted to me  yes  he had followed me in my travels  he 
had loitered in forests  hid himself in caves  or taken refuge in wide 
and desert heaths  and he now came to mark my progress and claim the 
fulfilment of my promise  
 
as i looked on him  his countenance expressed the utmost extent of 
malice and treachery  i thought with a sensation of madness on my 
promise of creating another like to him  and trembling with passion  
tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged  the wretch saw me 
destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for 
happiness  and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge  withdrew  
 
i left the room  and locking the door  made a solemn vow in my own 
heart never to resume my labours  and then  with trembling steps  i 
sought my own apartment  i was alone  none were near me to dissipate 
the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most 
terrible reveries  
 
several hours passed  and i remained near my window gazing on the sea  
it was almost motionless  for the winds were hushed  and all nature 
reposed under the eye of the quiet moon  a few fishing vessels alone 
specked the water  and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound 
of voices as the fishermen called to one another  i felt the silence  
although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity  until my ear 
was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore  and a 
person landed close to my house  
 
in a few minutes after  i heard the creaking of my door  as if some one 
endeavoured to open it softly  i trembled from head to foot  i felt a 
presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who 
dwelt in a cottage not far from mine  but i was overcome by the sensation 
of helplessness  so often felt in frightful dreams  when you in vain 
endeavour to fly from an impending danger  and was rooted to the spot  
 
presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage  the door 
opened  and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared  shutting the door  he 
approached me and said in a smothered voice  
 
   you have destroyed the work which you began  what is it that you 
intend  do you dare to break your promise  i have endured toil and misery  
i left switzerland with you  i crept along the shores of the rhine  among 
its willow islands and over the summits of its hills  i have dwelt many 
months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland  i have 
endured incalculable fatigue  and cold  and hunger  do you dare destroy my 
hopes     
 
   begone  i do break my promise  never will i create another like 
yourself  equal in deformity and wickedness     
 
   slave  i before reasoned with you  but you have proved yourself 
unworthy of my condescension  remember that i have power  you believe 
yourself miserable  but i can make you so wretched that the light of 
day will be hateful to you  you are my creator  but i am your master  
obey     
 
   the hour of my irresolution is past  and the period of your power is 
arrived  your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness  but 
they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in 
vice  shall i  in cool blood  set loose upon the earth a d  mon whose 
delight is in death and wretchedness  begone  i am firm  and your 
words will only exasperate my rage     
 
the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the 
impotence of anger     shall each man     cried he     find a 
wife for his bosom  and each beast have his mate  and i be alone  i had 
feelings of affection  and they were requited by detestation and scorn  
man  you may hate  but beware  your hours will pass in dread and misery  
and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for 
ever  are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my 
wretchedness  you can blast my other passions  but revenge 
remains   revenge  henceforth dearer than light or food  i may die  but 
first you  my tyrant and tormentor  shall curse the sun that gazes on your 
misery  beware  for i am fearless and therefore powerful  i will watch with 
the wiliness of a snake  that i may sting with its venom  man  you shall 
repent of the injuries you inflict     
 
   devil  cease  and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice  
i have declared my resolution to you  and i am no coward to bend 
beneath words  leave me  i am inexorable     
 
   it is well  i go  but remember  i shall be with you on your 
wedding-night     
 
i started forward and exclaimed     villain  before you sign my 
death-warrant  be sure that you are yourself safe     
 
i would have seized him  but he eluded me and quitted the house with 
precipitation  in a few moments i saw him in his boat  which shot 
across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the 
waves  
 
all was again silent  but his words rang in my ears  i burned with rage to 
pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean  i 
walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed  while my imagination 
conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me  why had i not 
followed him and closed with him in mortal strife  but i had suffered him 
to depart  and he had directed his course towards the mainland  i shuddered 
to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge  
and then i thought again of his words       i will be with you on 
your wedding-night      that  then  was the period fixed for the 
fulfilment of my destiny  in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and 
extinguish his malice  the prospect did not move me to fear  yet when i 
thought of my beloved elizabeth  of her tears and endless sorrow  when she 
should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her  tears  the first i 
had shed for many months  streamed from my eyes  and i resolved not to fall 
before my enemy without a bitter struggle  
 
the night passed away  and the sun rose from the ocean  my feelings became 
calmer  if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into 
the depths of despair  i left the house  the horrid scene of the last 
night   s contention  and walked on the beach of the sea  which i 
almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow 
creatures  nay  a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me  i 
desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock  wearily  it is true  
but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery  if i returned  it was to 
be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a 
d  mon whom i had myself created  
 
i walked about the isle like a restless spectre  separated from all it 
loved and miserable in the separation  when it became noon  and the 
sun rose higher  i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep 
sleep  i had been awake the whole of the preceding night  my nerves 
were agitated  and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery  the sleep 
into which i now sank refreshed me  and when i awoke  i again felt as 
if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself  and i began to 
reflect upon what had passed with greater composure  yet still the 
words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell  they appeared 
like a dream  yet distinct and oppressive as a reality  
 
the sun had far descended  and i still sat on the shore  satisfying my 
appetite  which had become ravenous  with an oaten cake  when i saw a 
fishing-boat land close to me  and one of the men brought me a packet  
it contained letters from geneva  and one from clerval entreating me to 
join him  he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where 
he was  that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired 
his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his 
indian enterprise  he could not any longer delay his departure  but as 
his journey to london might be followed  even sooner than he now 
conjectured  by his longer voyage  he entreated me to bestow as much of 
my society on him as i could spare  he besought me  therefore  to 
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth  that we might proceed 
southwards together  this letter in a degree recalled me to life  and 
i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days  
 
yet  before i departed  there was a task to perform  on which i shuddered 
to reflect  i must pack up my chemical instruments  and for that purpose i 
must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work  and i must 
handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me  the next 
morning  at daybreak  i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door 
of my laboratory  the remains of the half-finished creature  whom i had 
destroyed  lay scattered on the floor  and i almost felt as if i had 
mangled the living flesh of a human being  i paused to collect myself and 
then entered the chamber  with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments 
out of the room  but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my 
work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants  and i accordingly 
put them into a basket  with a great quantity of stones  and laying them 
up  determined to throw them into the sea that very night  and in the 
meantime i sat upon the beach  employed in cleaning and arranging my 
chemical apparatus  
 
nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place 
in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d  mon  i had 
before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that  with 
whatever consequences  must be fulfilled  but i now felt as if a film 
had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw 
clearly  the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur 
to me  the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts  but i did not 
reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it  i had resolved in 
my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made 
would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness  and i 
banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different 
conclusion  
 
between two and three in the morning the moon rose  and i then  putting my 
basket aboard a little skiff  sailed out about four miles from the shore  
the scene was perfectly solitary  a few boats were returning towards land  
but i sailed away from them  i felt as if i was about the commission of a 
dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my 
fellow creatures  at one time the moon  which had before been clear  was 
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud  and i took advantage of the moment of 
darkness and cast my basket into the sea  i listened to the gurgling sound 
as it sank and then sailed away from the spot  the sky became clouded  but 
the air was pure  although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then 
rising  but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations 
that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water  and fixing the rudder in a 
direct position  stretched myself at the bottom of the boat  clouds hid the 
moon  everything was obscure  and i heard only the sound of the boat as its 
keel cut through the waves  the murmur lulled me  and in a short time i 
slept soundly  
 
i do not know how long i remained in this situation  but when i awoke i 
found that the sun had already mounted considerably  the wind was high  and 
the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff  i found 
that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from 
which i had embarked  i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found 
that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with 
water  thus situated  my only resource was to drive before the wind  i 
confess that i felt a few sensations of terror  i had no compass with me 
and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the 
world that the sun was of little benefit to me  i might be driven into the 
wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in 
the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me  i had already 
been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst  a prelude to 
my other sufferings  i looked on the heavens  which were covered by clouds 
that flew before the wind  only to be replaced by others  i looked upon the 
sea  it was to be my grave     fiend     i exclaimed     your 
task is already fulfilled     i thought of elizabeth  of my father  and 
of clerval   all left behind  on whom the monster might satisfy his 
sanguinary and merciless passions  this idea plunged me into a reverie so 
despairing and frightful that even now  when the scene is on the point of 
closing before me for ever  i shudder to reflect on it  
 
some hours passed thus  but by degrees  as the sun declined towards the 
horizon  the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became 
free from breakers  but these gave place to a heavy swell  i felt sick 
and hardly able to hold the rudder  when suddenly i saw a line of high 
land towards the south  
 
almost spent  as i was  by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured 
for several hours  this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of 
warm joy to my heart  and tears gushed from my eyes  
 
how mutable are our feelings  and how strange is that clinging love we have 
of life even in the excess of misery  i constructed another sail with a 
part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land  it had a 
wild and rocky appearance  but as i approached nearer i easily perceived 
the traces of cultivation  i saw vessels near the shore and found myself 
suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man  i 
carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at 
length saw issuing from behind a small promontory  as i was in a state of 
extreme debility  i resolved to sail directly towards the town  as a place 
where i could most easily procure nourishment  fortunately i had money with 
me  as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good 
harbour  which i entered  my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected 
escape  
 
as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails  several 
people crowded towards the spot  they seemed much surprised at my 
appearance  but instead of offering me any assistance  whispered 
together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me 
a slight sensation of alarm  as it was  i merely remarked that they 
spoke english  and i therefore addressed them in that language     my 
good friends     said i     will you be so kind as to tell me the name of 
this town and inform me where i am     
 
   you will know that soon enough     replied a man with a hoarse voice  
   maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste  
but you will not be consulted as to your quarters  i promise you     
 
i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a 
stranger  and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and 
angry countenances of his companions     why do you answer me so 
roughly     i replied     surely it is not the custom of englishmen to 
receive strangers so inhospitably     
 
   i do not know     said the man     what the custom of the 
english may be  but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains     
 
while this strange dialogue continued  i perceived the crowd rapidly 
increase  their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger  which 
annoyed and in some degree alarmed me  i inquired the way to the inn  but 
no one replied  i then moved forward  and a murmuring sound arose from the 
crowd as they followed and surrounded me  when an ill-looking man 
approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said     come  sir  you must 
follow me to mr  kirwin   s to give an account of yourself     
 
   who is mr  kirwin  why am i to give an account of myself  is not 
this a free country     
 
   ay  sir  free enough for honest folks  mr  kirwin is a magistrate  
and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was 
found murdered here last night     
 
this answer startled me  but i presently recovered myself  i was innocent  
that could easily be proved  accordingly i followed my conductor in silence 
and was led to one of the best houses in the town  i was ready to sink from 
fatigue and hunger  but being surrounded by a crowd  i thought it politic 
to rouse all my strength  that no physical debility might be construed into 
apprehension or conscious guilt  little did i then expect the calamity that 
was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair 
all fear of ignominy or death  
 
i must pause here  for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of 
the frightful events which i am about to relate  in proper detail  to my 
recollection  
 
 
 
 
chapter 21 
 
 
i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate  an old 
benevolent man with calm and mild manners  he looked upon me  however  
with some degree of severity  and then  turning towards my conductors  
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion  
 
about half a dozen men came forward  and  one being selected by the 
magistrate  he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with 
his son and brother-in-law  daniel nugent  when  about ten o   clock  
they observed a strong northerly blast rising  and they accordingly put in 
for port  it was a very dark night  as the moon had not yet risen  they did 
not land at the harbour  but  as they had been accustomed  at a creek about 
two miles below  he walked on first  carrying a part of the fishing tackle  
and his companions followed him at some distance  as he was proceeding 
along the sands  he struck his foot against something and fell at his 
length on the ground  his companions came up to assist him  and by the 
light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man  
who was to all appearance dead  their first supposition was that it was the 
corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the 
waves  but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even 
that the body was not then cold  they instantly carried it to the cottage 
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured  but in vain  to restore it 
to life  it appeared to be a handsome young man  about five and twenty 
years of age  he had apparently been strangled  for there was no sign of 
any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck  
 
the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me  but 
when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of 
my brother and felt myself extremely agitated  my limbs trembled  and a 
mist came over my eyes  which obliged me to lean on a chair for 
support  the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew 
an unfavourable augury from my manner  
 
the son confirmed his father   s account  but when daniel nugent was 
called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion  he 
saw a boat  with a single man in it  at a short distance from the shore  
and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars  it was the same 
boat in which i had just landed  
 
a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door 
of her cottage  waiting for the return of the fishermen  about an hour 
before she heard of the discovery of the body  when she saw a boat with 
only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse 
was afterwards found  
 
another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the 
body into her house  it was not cold  they put it into a bed and 
rubbed it  and daniel went to the town for an apothecary  but life was 
quite gone  
 
several other men were examined concerning my landing  and they agreed 
that  with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night  it 
was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been 
obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed  
besides  they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body 
from another place  and it was likely that as i did not appear to know 
the shore  i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance 
of the town of        from the place where i had deposited the corpse  
 
mr  kirwin  on hearing this evidence  desired that i should be taken into 
the room where the body lay for interment  that it might be observed what 
effect the sight of it would produce upon me  this idea was probably 
suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the 
murder had been described  i was accordingly conducted  by the magistrate 
and several other persons  to the inn  i could not help being struck by the 
strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night  but  
knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had 
inhabited about the time that the body had been found  i was perfectly 
tranquil as to the consequences of the affair  
 
i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin  how 
can i describe my sensations on beholding it  i feel yet parched with 
horror  nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and 
agony  the examination  the presence of the magistrate and witnesses  
passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry 
clerval stretched before me  i gasped for breath  and throwing myself on 
the body  i exclaimed     have my murderous machinations deprived you 
also  my dearest henry  of life  two i have already destroyed  other 
victims await their destiny  but you  clerval  my friend  my 
benefactor       
 
the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured  and 
i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions  
 
a fever succeeded to this  i lay for two months on the point of death  my 
ravings  as i afterwards heard  were frightful  i called myself the 
murderer of william  of justine  and of clerval  sometimes i entreated my 
attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was 
tormented  and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping 
my neck  and screamed aloud with agony and terror  fortunately  as i spoke 
my native language  mr  kirwin alone understood me  but my gestures and 
bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses  
 
why did i not die  more miserable than man ever was before  why did i not 
sink into forgetfulness and rest  death snatches away many blooming 
children  the only hopes of their doting parents  how many brides and 
youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope  and the 
next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb  of what materials was i 
made that i could thus resist so many shocks  which  like the turning of 
the wheel  continually renewed the torture  
 
but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from 
a dream  in a prison  stretched on a wretched bed  surrounded by 
gaolers  turnkeys  bolts  and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon  
it was morning  i remember  when i thus awoke to understanding  i had 
forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some 
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me  but when i looked around 
and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i 
was  all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly  
 
this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside 
me  she was a hired nurse  the wife of one of the turnkeys  and her 
countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise 
that class  the lines of her face were hard and rude  like that of 
persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery  her 
tone expressed her entire indifference  she addressed me in english  
and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings  
 
   are you better now  sir     said she  
 
i replied in the same language  with a feeble voice     i believe i am  
but if it be all true  if indeed i did not dream  i am sorry that i am 
still alive to feel this misery and horror     
 
   for that matter     replied the old woman     if you mean about the 
gentleman you murdered  i believe that it were better for you if you 
were dead  for i fancy it will go hard with you  however  that   s none 
of my business  i am sent to nurse you and get you well  i do my duty 
with a safe conscience  it were well if everybody did the same     
 
i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a 
speech to a person just saved  on the very edge of death  but i felt 
languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed  the whole series 
of my life appeared to me as a dream  i sometimes doubted if indeed it 
were all true  for it never presented itself to my mind with the force 
of reality  
 
as the images that floated before me became more distinct  i grew 
feverish  a darkness pressed around me  no one was near me who soothed 
me with the gentle voice of love  no dear hand supported me  the 
physician came and prescribed medicines  and the old woman prepared 
them for me  but utter carelessness was visible in the first  and the 
expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the 
second  who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the 
hangman who would gain his fee  
 
these were my first reflections  but i soon learned that mr  kirwin had 
shown me extreme kindness  he had caused the best room in the prison 
to be prepared for me  wretched indeed was the best   and it was he who 
had provided a physician and a nurse  it is true  he seldom came to 
see me  for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of 
every human creature  he did not wish to be present at the agonies and 
miserable ravings of a murderer  he came  therefore  sometimes to see 
that i was not neglected  but his visits were short and with long 
intervals  
 
one day  while i was gradually recovering  i was seated in a chair  my eyes 
half open and my cheeks livid like those in death  i was overcome by gloom 
and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to 
remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness  at one time i 
considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the 
penalty of the law  less innocent than poor justine had been  such were my 
thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr  kirwin entered  
his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion  he drew a chair close to 
mine and addressed me in french  
 
   i fear that this place is very shocking to you  can i do anything to 
make you more comfortable     
 
   i thank you  but all that you mention is nothing to me  on the whole 
earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving     
 
   i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to 
one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune  but you will  i 
hope  soon quit this melancholy abode  for doubtless evidence can 
easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge     
 
   that is my least concern  i am  by a course of strange events  become 
the most miserable of mortals  persecuted and tortured as i am and 
have been  can death be any evil to me     
 
   nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the 
strange chances that have lately occurred  you were thrown  by some 
surprising accident  on this shore  renowned for its hospitality  
seized immediately  and charged with murder  the first sight that was 
presented to your eyes was the body of your friend  murdered in so 
unaccountable a manner and placed  as it were  by some fiend across 
your path     
 
as mr  kirwin said this  notwithstanding the agitation i endured on 
this retrospect of my sufferings  i also felt considerable surprise at 
the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me  i suppose some 
astonishment was exhibited in my countenance  for mr  kirwin hastened 
to say  
 
   immediately upon your being taken ill  all the papers that were on 
your person were brought me  and i examined them that i might discover some 
trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune 
and illness  i found several letters  and  among others  one which i 
discovered from its commencement to be from your father  i instantly wrote 
to geneva  nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter  
but you are ill  even now you tremble  you are unfit for agitation of any 
kind     
 
   this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event  
tell me what new scene of death has been acted  and whose murder i am 
now to lament     
 
   your family is perfectly well     said mr  kirwin with 
gentleness     and someone  a friend  is come to visit you     
 
i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself  but it 
instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my 
misery and taunt me with the death of clerval  as a new incitement for 
me to comply with his hellish desires  i put my hand before my eyes  
and cried out in agony  
 
   oh  take him away  i cannot see him  for god   s sake  do not 
let him enter     
 
mr  kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance  he could not help 
regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in 
rather a severe tone  
 
   i should have thought  young man  that the presence of your father 
would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance     
 
   my father     cried i  while every feature and every muscle was relaxed 
from anguish to pleasure     is my father indeed come  how kind  how 
very kind  but where is he  why does he not hasten to me     
 
my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate  perhaps he 
thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium  
and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence  he rose and 
quitted the room with my nurse  and in a moment my father entered it  
 
nothing  at this moment  could have given me greater pleasure than the 
arrival of my father  i stretched out my hand to him and cried  
 
   are you then safe   and elizabeth   and ernest     
 
my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured  by 
dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart  to raise my 
desponding spirits  but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of 
cheerfulness     what a place is this that you inhabit  my son     
said he  looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance 
of the room     you travelled to seek happiness  but a fatality seems 
to pursue you  and poor clerval       
 
the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too 
great to be endured in my weak state  i shed tears  
 
   alas  yes  my father     replied i     some destiny of the 
most horrible kind hangs over me  and i must live to fulfil it  or surely i 
should have died on the coffin of henry     
 
we were not allowed to converse for any length of time  for the 
precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that 
could ensure tranquillity  mr  kirwin came in and insisted that my 
strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion  but the 
appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel  and i 
gradually recovered my health  
 
as my sickness quitted me  i was absorbed by a gloomy and black 
melancholy that nothing could dissipate  the image of clerval was 
for ever before me  ghastly and murdered  more than once the agitation 
into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous 
relapse  alas  why did they preserve so miserable and detested a 
life  it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny  which is now 
drawing to a close  soon  oh  very soon  will death extinguish these 
throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears 
me to the dust  and  in executing the award of justice  i shall also 
sink to rest  then the appearance of death was distant  although the 
wish was ever present to my thoughts  and i often sat for hours 
motionless and speechless  wishing for some mighty revolution that 
might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins  
 
the season of the assizes approached  i had already been three months 
in prison  and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a 
relapse  i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country 
town where the court was held  mr  kirwin charged himself with every 
care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence  i was spared 
the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal  as the case was not 
brought before the court that decides on life and death  the grand 
jury rejected the bill  on its being proved that i was on the orkney 
islands at the hour the body of my friend was found  and a fortnight 
after my removal i was liberated from prison  
 
my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a 
criminal charge  that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh 
atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country  i did not 
participate in these feelings  for to me the walls of a dungeon or a 
palace were alike hateful  the cup of life was poisoned for ever  and 
although the sun shone upon me  as upon the happy and gay of heart  i 
saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness  penetrated by 
no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me  sometimes 
they were the expressive eyes of henry  languishing in death  the dark 
orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed 
them  sometimes it was the watery  clouded eyes of the monster  as i 
first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt  
 
my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection  he talked 
of geneva  which i should soon visit  of elizabeth and ernest  but 
these words only drew deep groans from me  sometimes  indeed  i felt a 
wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved 
cousin or longed  with a devouring  maladie du pays   to see once more 
the blue lake and rapid rhone  that had been so dear to me in early 
childhood  but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a 
prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature  and 
these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and 
despair  at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the 
existence i loathed  and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance 
to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence  
 
yet one duty remained to me  the recollection of which finally 
triumphed over my selfish despair  it was necessary that i should 
return without delay to geneva  there to watch over the lives of those 
i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer  that if any 
chance led me to the place of his concealment  or if he dared again to 
blast me by his presence  i might  with unfailing aim  put an end to 
the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the 
mockery of a soul still more monstrous  my father still desired to 
delay our departure  fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a 
journey  for i was a shattered wreck   the shadow of a human being  my 
strength was gone  i was a mere skeleton  and fever night and day 
preyed upon my wasted frame  
 
still  as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience  
my father thought it best to yield  we took our passage on board a vessel 
bound for havre-de-grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores  
it was midnight  i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to 
the dashing of the waves  i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my 
sight  and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should 
soon see geneva  the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream  
yet the vessel in which i was  the wind that blew me from the detested 
shore of ireland  and the sea which surrounded me  told me too forcibly 
that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval  my friend and dearest 
companion  had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation  i 
repassed  in my memory  my whole life  my quiet happiness while residing 
with my family in geneva  the death of my mother  and my departure for 
ingolstadt  i remembered  shuddering  the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on 
to the creation of my hideous enemy  and i called to mind the night in 
which he first lived  i was unable to pursue the train of thought  a 
thousand feelings pressed upon me  and i wept bitterly  
 
ever since my recovery from the fever  i had been in the custom of taking 
every night a small quantity of laudanum  for it was by means of this drug 
only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of 
life  oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes  i now 
swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly  but sleep did 
not afford me respite from thought and misery  my dreams presented a 
thousand objects that scared me  towards morning i was possessed by a kind 
of nightmare  i felt the fiend   s grasp in my neck and could not free 
myself from it  groans and cries rang in my ears  my father  who was 
watching over me  perceiving my restlessness  awoke me  the dashing waves 
were around  the cloudy sky above  the fiend was not here  a sense of 
security  a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour 
and the irresistible  disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm 
forgetfulness  of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly 
susceptible

the voyage came to an end  we landed  and proceeded to paris  i soon 
found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i 
could continue my journey  my father   s care and attentions were 
indefatigable  but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and 
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill  he wished me to 
seek amusement in society  i abhorred the face of man  oh  not 
abhorred  they were my brethren  my fellow beings  and i felt 
attracted even to the most repulsive among them  as to creatures of an 
angelic nature and celestial mechanism  but i felt that i had no right 
to share their intercourse  i had unchained an enemy among them whose 
joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans  how they 
would  each and all  abhor me and hunt me from the world  did they know 
my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me  
 
my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by 
various arguments to banish my despair  sometimes he thought that i 
felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of 
murder  and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride  
 
   alas  my father     said i     how little do you know me   
human beings  their feelings and passions  would indeed be degraded if such 
a wretch as i felt pride  justine  poor unhappy justine  was as innocent 
as i  and she suffered the same charge  she died for it  and i am the cause 
of this   i murdered her  william  justine  and henry   they all 
died by my hands     
 
my father had often  during my imprisonment  heard me make the same 
assertion  when i thus accused myself  he sometimes seemed to desire an 
explanation  and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of 
delirium  and that  during my illness  some idea of this kind had presented 
itself to my imagination  the remembrance of which i preserved in my 
convalescence  i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence 
concerning the wretch i had created  i had a persuasion that i should be 
supposed mad  and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue  but  
besides  i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my 
hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of 
his breast  i checked  therefore  my impatient thirst for sympathy and was 
silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret  
yet  still  words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably 
from me  i could offer no explanation of them  but their truth in part 
relieved the burden of my mysterious woe  
 
upon this occasion my father said  with an expression of unbounded wonder  
   my dearest victor  what infatuation is this  my dear son  i entreat 
you never to make such an assertion again     
 
   i am not mad     i cried energetically     the sun and the heavens  who 
have viewed my operations  can bear witness of my truth  i am the 
assassin of those most innocent victims  they died by my machinations  
a thousand times would i have shed my own blood  drop by drop  to have 
saved their lives  but i could not  my father  indeed i could not 
sacrifice the whole human race     
 
the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were 
deranged  and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and 
endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts  he wished as much as 
possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in 
ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my 
misfortunes  
 
as time passed away i became more calm  misery had her dwelling in my 
heart  but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own 
crimes  sufficient for me was the consciousness of them  by the utmost 
self-violence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness  which 
sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world  and my manners 
were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey 
to the sea of ice  
 
a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland  i received the 
following letter from elizabeth  
 
   my dear friend  
 
   it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle 
dated at paris  you are no longer at a formidable distance  and i may 
hope to see you in less than a fortnight  my poor cousin  how much you 
must have suffered  i expect to see you looking even more ill than 
when you quitted geneva  this winter has been passed most miserably  
tortured as i have been by anxious suspense  yet i hope to see peace in 
your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of 
comfort and tranquillity  
 
   yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable 
a year ago  even perhaps augmented by time  i would not disturb you at 
this period  when so many misfortunes weigh upon you  but a 
conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders 
some explanation necessary before we meet  
 
explanation  you may possibly say  what can elizabeth have to explain  if 
you really say this  my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied  
but you are distant from me  and it is possible that you may dread and yet 
be pleased with this explanation  and in a probability of this being the 
case  i dare not any longer postpone writing what  during your absence  i 
have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin  
 
   you well know  victor  that our union had been the favourite plan of 
your parents ever since our infancy  we were told this when young  and 
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take 
place  we were affectionate playfellows during childhood  and  i 
believe  dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older  but 
as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each 
other without desiring a more intimate union  may not such also be our 
case  tell me  dearest victor  answer me  i conjure you by our mutual 
happiness  with simple truth   do you not love another  
 
   you have travelled  you have spent several years of your life at 
ingolstadt  and i confess to you  my friend  that when i saw you last 
autumn so unhappy  flying to solitude from the society of every 
creature  i could not help supposing that you might regret our 
connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of 
your parents  although they opposed themselves to your inclinations  
but this is false reasoning  i confess to you  my friend  that i love 
you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant 
friend and companion  but it is your happiness i desire as well as my 
own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally 
miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice  even now 
i weep to think that  borne down as you are by the cruellest 
misfortunes  you may stifle  by the word  honour   all hope of that 
love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself  i  who 
have so disinterested an affection for you  may increase your miseries 
tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes  ah  victor  be assured 
that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be 
made miserable by this supposition  be happy  my friend  and if you 
obey me in this one request  remain satisfied that nothing on earth 
will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity  
 
   do not let this letter disturb you  do not answer tomorrow  or the 
next day  or even until you come  if it will give you pain  my uncle 
will send me news of your health  and if i see but one smile on your 
lips when we meet  occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine  i 
shall need no other happiness

   geneva  may 18th  17       
 
 
 
this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten  the threat of 
the fiend       i will be with you on your 
wedding-night      such was my sentence  and on that night would the 
d  mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of 
happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings  on that night he 
had determined to consummate his crimes by my death  well  be it so  a 
deadly struggle would then assuredly take place  in which if he were 
victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end  if he 
were vanquished  i should be a free man  alas  what freedom  such as the 
peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes  his 
cottage burnt  his lands laid waste  and he is turned adrift  homeless  
penniless  and alone  but free  such would be my liberty except that in my 
elizabeth i possessed a treasure  alas  balanced by those horrors of 
remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death  
 
sweet and beloved elizabeth  i read and reread her letter  and some 
softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal 
dreams of love and joy  but the apple was already eaten  and the 
angel   s arm bared to drive me from all hope  yet i would die to make 
her happy  if the monster executed his threat  death was inevitable  yet  
again  i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate  my 
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner  but if my torturer 
should suspect that i postponed it  influenced by his menaces  he would 
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge  he had vowed 
 to be with me on my wedding-night   yet he did not consider that 
threat as binding him to peace in the meantime  for as if to show me that 
he was not yet satiated with blood  he had murdered clerval immediately 
after the enunciation of his threats  i resolved  therefore  that if my 
immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my 
father   s happiness  my adversary   s designs against my life 
should not retard it a single hour  
 
in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth  my letter was calm and 
affectionate     i fear  my beloved girl     i said     little happiness 
remains for us on earth  yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in 
you  chase away your idle fears  to you alone do i consecrate my life 
and my endeavours for contentment  i have one secret  elizabeth  a 
dreadful one  when revealed to you  it will chill your frame with 
horror  and then  far from being surprised at my misery  you will only 
wonder that i survive what i have endured  i will confide this tale of 
misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place  
for  my sweet cousin  there must be perfect confidence between us  but 
until then  i conjure you  do not mention or allude to it  this i most 
earnestly entreat  and i know you will comply     
 
in about a week after the arrival of elizabeth   s letter we returned 
to geneva  the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection  yet tears were 
in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks  i saw a 
change in her also  she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly 
vivacity that had before charmed me  but her gentleness and soft looks of 
compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i 
was  
 
the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure  memory brought madness 
with it  and when i thought of what had passed  a real insanity possessed 
me  sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage  sometimes low and 
despondent  i neither spoke nor looked at anyone  but sat motionless  
bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me  
 
elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits  her gentle voice 
would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human 
feelings when sunk in torpor  she wept with me and for me  when reason 
returned  she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with 
resignation  ah  it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned  but for the 
guilty there is no peace  the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is 
otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief  
 
soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with 
elizabeth  i remained silent  
 
   have you  then  some other attachment     
 
   none on earth  i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with 
delight  let the day therefore be fixed  and on it i will consecrate 
myself  in life or death  to the happiness of my cousin     
 
   my dear victor  do not speak thus  heavy misfortunes have befallen 
us  but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love 
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live  our circle will be 
small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune  
and when time shall have softened your despair  new and dear objects of 
care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly 
deprived     
 
such were the lessons of my father  but to me the remembrance of the 
threat returned  nor can you wonder that  omnipotent as the fiend had 
yet been in his deeds of blood  i should almost regard him as 
invincible  and that when he had pronounced the words     i shall be with 
you on your wedding-night      i should regard the threatened fate as 
unavoidable  but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were 
balanced with it  and i therefore  with a contented and even cheerful 
countenance  agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent  the 
ceremony should take place in ten days  and thus put  as i imagined  
the seal to my fate  
 
great god  if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish 
intention of my fiendish adversary  i would rather have banished myself 
for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over 
the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage  but  as if 
possessed of magic powers  the monster had blinded me to his real 
intentions  and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death  i 
hastened that of a far dearer victim  
 
as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer  whether from cowardice or 
a prophetic feeling  i felt my heart sink within me  but i concealed my 
feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the 
countenance of my father  but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer 
eye of elizabeth  she looked forward to our union with placid contentment  
not unmingled with a little fear  which past misfortunes had impressed  
that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate 
into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret  
 
preparations were made for the event  congratulatory visits were received  
and all wore a smiling appearance  i shut up  as well as i could  in my own 
heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness 
into the plans of my father  although they might only serve as the 
decorations of my tragedy  through my father   s exertions a part of 
the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian 
government  a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her  it 
was agreed that  immediately after our union  we should proceed to villa 
lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake 
near which it stood  
 
in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the 
fiend should openly attack me  i carried pistols and a dagger 
constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice  and 
by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity  indeed  as the 
period approached  the threat appeared more as a delusion  not to be 
regarded as worthy to disturb my peace  while the happiness i hoped for 
in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed 
for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of 
as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent  
 
elizabeth seemed happy  my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to 
calm her mind  but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my 
destiny  she was melancholy  and a presentiment of evil pervaded her  
and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had 
promised to reveal to her on the following day  my father was in the 
meantime overjoyed  and  in the bustle of preparation  only recognised in 
the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride  
 
after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my 
father   s  but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our 
journey by water  sleeping that night at evian and continuing our 
voyage on the following day  the day was fair  the wind favourable  
all smiled on our nuptial embarkation  
 
those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the 
feeling of happiness  we passed rapidly along  the sun was hot  but we 
were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the 
beauty of the scene  sometimes on one side of the lake  where we saw 
mont sal  ve  the pleasant banks of montal  gre  and at a distance  
surmounting all  the beautiful mont blanc  and the assemblage of snowy 
mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her  sometimes coasting the 
opposite banks  we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the 
ambition that would quit its native country  and an almost 
insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it  
 
i took the hand of elizabeth     you are sorrowful  my love  ah  if 
you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure  you would 
endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this 
one day at least permits me to enjoy     
 
   be happy  my dear victor     replied elizabeth     there is  i hope  
nothing to distress you  and be assured that if a lively joy is not 
painted in my face  my heart is contented  something whispers to me 
not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us  but i 
will not listen to such a sinister voice  observe how fast we move 
along and how the clouds  which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise 
above the dome of mont blanc  render this scene of beauty still more 
interesting  look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in 
the clear waters  where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at 
the bottom  what a divine day  how happy and serene all nature 
appears     
 
thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all 
reflection upon melancholy subjects  but her temper was fluctuating  
joy for a few instants shone in her eyes  but it continually gave place 
to distraction and reverie  
 
the sun sank lower in the heavens  we passed the river drance and 
observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the 
lower hills  the alps here come closer to the lake  and we approached 
the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary  the 
spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range 
of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung  
 
the wind  which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity  
sank at sunset to a light breeze  the soft air just ruffled the water 
and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the 
shore  from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and 
hay  the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed  and as i touched 
the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp 
me and cling to me for ever  
 
 
 
 
chapter 23 
 
 
it was eight o   clock when we landed  we walked for a short time on the 
shore  enjoying the transitory light  and then retired to the inn and 
contemplated the lovely scene of waters  woods  and mountains  obscured 
in darkness  yet still displaying their black outlines  
 
the wind  which had fallen in the south  now rose with great violence 
in the west  the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was 
beginning to descend  the clouds swept across it swifter than the 
flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays  while the lake reflected the 
scene of the busy heavens  rendered still busier by the restless waves 
that were beginning to rise  suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended  
 
i had been calm during the day  but so soon as night obscured the 
shapes of objects  a thousand fears arose in my mind  i was anxious 
and watchful  while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in 
my bosom  every sound terrified me  but i resolved that i would sell my 
life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that 
of my adversary was extinguished  
 
elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence  
but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her  and 
trembling  she asked     what is it that agitates you  my dear victor  
what is it you fear     
 
   oh  peace  peace  my love     replied i     this night  and 
all will be safe  but this night is dreadful  very dreadful     
 
i passed an hour in this state of mind  when suddenly i reflected how 
fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife  
and i earnestly entreated her to retire  resolving not to join her 
until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy  
 
she left me  and i continued some time walking up and down the passages 
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to 
my adversary  but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to 
conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the 
execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful 
scream  it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired  as i 
heard it  the whole truth rushed into my mind  my arms dropped  the 
motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended  i could feel the blood 
trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs  this 
state lasted but for an instant  the scream was repeated  and i rushed 
into the room  
 
great god  why did i not then expire  why am i here to relate the 
destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth  she was 
there  lifeless and inanimate  thrown across the bed  her head hanging down 
and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair  everywhere i 
turn i see the same figure   her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung 
by the murderer on its bridal bier  could i behold this and live  alas  
life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated  for a moment 
only did i lose recollection  i fell senseless on the ground  
 
when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn  their 
countenances expressed a breathless terror  but the horror of others 
appeared only as a mockery  a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me  i 
escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth  my love  my 
wife  so lately living  so dear  so worthy  she had been moved from the 
posture in which i had first beheld her  and now  as she lay  her head upon 
her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck  i might have 
supposed her asleep  i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour  but 
the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held 
in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished  
the murderous mark of the fiend   s grasp was on her neck  and the 
breath had ceased to issue from her lips  
 
while i still hung over her in the agony of despair  i happened to look up  
the windows of the room had before been darkened  and i felt a kind of 
panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber  
the shutters had been thrown back  and with a sensation of horror not to be 
described  i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred  
a grin was on the face of the monster  he seemed to jeer  as with his 
fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife  i rushed towards 
the window  and drawing a pistol from my bosom  fired  but he eluded me  
leaped from his station  and running with the swiftness of lightning  
plunged into the lake  
 
the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room  i pointed to 
the spot where he had disappeared  and we followed the track with 
boats  nets were cast  but in vain  after passing several hours  we 
returned hopeless  most of my companions believing it to have been a 
form conjured up by my fancy  after having landed  they proceeded to 
search the country  parties going in different directions among the 
woods and vines  
 
i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the 
house  but my head whirled round  my steps were like those of a drunken 
man  i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion  a film covered my 
eyes  and my skin was parched with the heat of fever  in this state i 
was carried back and placed on a bed  hardly conscious of what had 
happened  my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that 
i had lost  
 
after an interval i arose  and as if by instinct  crawled into the room 
where the corpse of my beloved lay  there were women weeping around  i 
hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs  all this time no 
distinct idea presented itself to my mind  but my thoughts rambled to 
various subjects  reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their 
cause  i was bewildered  in a cloud of wonder and horror  the death 
of william  the execution of justine  the murder of clerval  and lastly 
of my wife  even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining 
friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend  my father even now 
might be writhing under his grasp  and ernest might be dead at his 
feet  this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action  i started 
up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed  
 
there were no horses to be procured  and i must return by the lake  but the 
wind was unfavourable  and the rain fell in torrents  however  it was 
hardly morning  and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night  i hired men 
to row and took an oar myself  for i had always experienced relief from 
mental torment in bodily exercise  but the overflowing misery i now felt  
and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any 
exertion  i threw down the oar  and leaning my head upon my hands  gave way 
to every gloomy idea that arose  if i looked up  i saw scenes which were 
familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day 
before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection  
tears streamed from my eyes  the rain had ceased for a moment  and i saw 
the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before  they had 
then been observed by elizabeth  nothing is so painful to the human mind as 
a great and sudden change  the sun might shine or the clouds might lower  
but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before  a fiend had 
snatched from me every hope of future happiness  no creature had ever been 
so miserable as i was  so frightful an event is single in the history of 
man  
 
but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last 
overwhelming event  mine has been a tale of horrors  i have reached their 
 acme   and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you  know 
that  one by one  my friends were snatched away  i was left desolate  my 
own strength is exhausted  and i must tell  in a few words  what remains of 
my hideous narration  
 
i arrived at geneva  my father and ernest yet lived  but the former sunk 
under the tidings that i bore  i see him now  excellent and venerable old 
man  his eyes wandered in vacancy  for they had lost their charm and their 
delight   his elizabeth  his more than daughter  whom he doted on with 
all that affection which a man feels  who in the decline of life  having 
few affections  clings more earnestly to those that remain  cursed  cursed 
be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste 
in wretchedness  he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated 
around him  the springs of existence suddenly gave way  he was unable to 
rise from his bed  and in a few days he died in my arms  
 
what then became of me  i know not  i lost sensation  and chains and 
darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me  sometimes  
indeed  i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales 
with the friends of my youth  but i awoke and found myself in a 
dungeon  melancholy followed  but by degrees i gained a clear 
conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my 
prison  for they had called me mad  and during many months  as i 
understood  a solitary cell had been my habitation  
 
liberty  however  had been a useless gift to me  had i not  as i 
awakened to reason  at the same time awakened to revenge  as the 
memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me  i began to reflect on their 
cause   the monster whom i had created  the miserable d  mon whom i had 
sent abroad into the world for my destruction  i was possessed by a 
maddening rage when i thought of him  and desired and ardently prayed 
that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal 
revenge on his cursed head  
 
nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes  i began to 
reflect on the best means of securing him  and for this purpose  about 
a month after my release  i repaired to a criminal judge in the town 
and told him that i had an accusation to make  that i knew the 
destroyer of my family  and that i required him to exert his whole 
authority for the apprehension of the murderer  
 
the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness     be 
assured  sir     said he     no pains or exertions on my part shall 
be spared to discover the villain     
 
   i thank you     replied i     listen  therefore  to the 
deposition that i have to make  it is indeed a tale so strange that i 
should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth 
which  however wonderful  forces conviction  the story is too connected to 
be mistaken for a dream  and i have no motive for falsehood     my 
manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm  i had formed in my 
own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death  and this purpose 
quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life  i now related 
my history briefly but with firmness and precision  marking the dates with 
accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation  
 
the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous  but as i continued 
he became more attentive and interested  i saw him sometimes shudder with 
horror  at others a lively surprise  unmingled with disbelief  was painted 
on his countenance  
 
when i had concluded my narration  i said     this is the being whom i 
accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your 
whole power  it is your duty as a magistrate  and i believe and hope that 
your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those 
functions on this occasion     
 
this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own 
auditor  he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given 
to a tale of spirits and supernatural events  but when he was called upon 
to act officially in consequence  the whole tide of his incredulity 
returned  he  however  answered mildly     i would willingly afford you 
every aid in your pursuit  but the creature of whom you speak appears to 
have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance  who can follow an 
animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where 
no man would venture to intrude  besides  some months have elapsed since 
the commission of his crimes  and no one can conjecture to what place he 
has wandered or what region he may now inhabit     
 
   i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit  and if 
he has indeed taken refuge in the alps  he may be hunted like the chamois 
and destroyed as a beast of prey  but i perceive your thoughts  you do not 
credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the 
punishment which is his desert     
 
as i spoke  rage sparkled in my eyes  the magistrate was intimidated  
   you are mistaken     said he     i will exert myself  and if 
it is in my power to seize the monster  be assured that he shall suffer 
punishment proportionate to his crimes  but i fear  from what you have 
yourself described to be his properties  that this will prove 
impracticable  and thus  while every proper measure is pursued  you should 
make up your mind to disappointment     
 
   that cannot be  but all that i can say will be of little avail  my 
revenge is of no moment to you  yet  while i allow it to be a vice  i 
confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul  my rage 
is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer  whom i have turned 
loose upon society  still exists  you refuse my just demand  i have 
but one resource  and i devote myself  either in my life or death  to 
his destruction     
 
i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this  there was a frenzy 
in my manner  and something  i doubt not  of that haughty fierceness 
which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed  but to a genevan 
magistrate  whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of 
devotion and heroism  this elevation of mind had much the appearance of 
madness  he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and 
reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium  
 
   man     i cried     how ignorant art thou in thy pride of 
wisdom  cease  you know not what it is you say     
 
i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on 
some other mode of action  
 
 
 
 
chapter 24 
 
 
my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was 
swallowed up and lost  i was hurried away by fury  revenge alone 
endowed me with strength and composure  it moulded my feelings and 
allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise 
delirium or death would have been my portion  
 
my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever  my country  which  when i 
was happy and beloved  was dear to me  now  in my adversity  became 
hateful  i provided myself with a sum of money  together with a few jewels 
which had belonged to my mother  and departed  
 
and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life  i have 
traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships 
which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet  how i 
have lived i hardly know  many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon 
the sandy plain and prayed for death  but revenge kept me alive  i dared 
not die and leave my adversary in being  
 
when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i 
might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy  but my plan was unsettled  
and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town  uncertain 
what path i should pursue  as night approached i found myself at the 
entrance of the cemetery where william  elizabeth  and my father 
reposed  i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their 
graves  everything was silent except the leaves of the trees  which 
were gently agitated by the wind  the night was nearly dark  and the 
scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested 
observer  the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to 
cast a shadow  which was felt but not seen  around the head of the 
mourner  
 
the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to 
rage and despair  they were dead  and i lived  their murderer also lived  
and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence  i knelt on the grass 
and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed     by the 
sacred earth on which i kneel  by the shades that wander near me  by the 
deep and eternal grief that i feel  i swear  and by thee  o night  and the 
spirits that preside over thee  to pursue the d  mon who caused this misery  
until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict  for this purpose i will 
preserve my life  to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun 
and tread the green herbage of earth  which otherwise should vanish from my 
eyes for ever  and i call on you  spirits of the dead  and on you  wandering 
ministers of vengeance  to aid and conduct me in my work  let the cursed 
and hellish monster drink deep of agony  let him feel the despair that now 
torments me     
 
i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me 
that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion  but 
the furies possessed me as i concluded  and rage choked my utterance  
 
i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish 
laugh  it rang on my ears long and heavily  the mountains re-echoed 
it  and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter  
surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have 
destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i 
was reserved for vengeance  the laughter died away  when a well-known 
and abhorred voice  apparently close to my ear  addressed me in an 
audible whisper     i am satisfied  miserable wretch  you have 
determined to live  and i am satisfied     
 
i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded  but the devil 
eluded my grasp  suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone 
full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than 
mortal speed  
 
i pursued him  and for many months this has been my task  guided by a 
slight clue  i followed the windings of the rhone  but vainly  the 
blue mediterranean appeared  and by a strange chance  i saw the fiend 
enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea  i 
took my passage in the same ship  but he escaped  i know not how  
 
amidst the wilds of tartary and russia  although he still evaded me  i 
have ever followed in his track  sometimes the peasants  scared by 
this horrid apparition  informed me of his path  sometimes he himself  
who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die  
left some mark to guide me  the snows descended on my head  and i saw 
the print of his huge step on the white plain  to you first entering 
on life  to whom care is new and agony unknown  how can you understand 
what i have felt and still feel  cold  want  and fatigue were the 
least pains which i was destined to endure  i was cursed by some devil 
and carried about with me my eternal hell  yet still a spirit of good 
followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly 
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties  sometimes  
when nature  overcome by hunger  sank under the exhaustion  a repast 
was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me  the 
fare was  indeed  coarse  such as the peasants of the country ate  but 
i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had 
invoked to aid me  often  when all was dry  the heavens cloudless  and 
i was parched by thirst  a slight cloud would bedim the sky  shed the 
few drops that revived me  and vanish  
 
i followed  when i could  the courses of the rivers  but the d  mon 
generally avoided these  as it was here that the population of the 
country chiefly collected  in other places human beings were seldom 
seen  and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my 
path  i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers 
by distributing it  or i brought with me some food that i had killed  
which  after taking a small part  i always presented to those who had 
provided me with fire and utensils for cooking  
 
my life  as it passed thus  was indeed hateful to me  and it was during 
sleep alone that i could taste joy  o blessed sleep  often  when most 
miserable  i sank to repose  and my dreams lulled me even to rapture  the 
spirits that guarded me had provided these moments  or rather hours  of 
happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage  deprived of 
this respite  i should have sunk under my hardships  during the day i was 
sustained and inspirited by the hope of night  for in sleep i saw my 
friends  my wife  and my beloved country  again i saw the benevolent 
countenance of my father  heard the silver tones of my elizabeth   s 
voice  and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth  often  when wearied by 
a toilsome march  i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should 
come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest 
friends  what agonising fondness did i feel for them  how did i cling to 
their dear forms  as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours  and 
persuade myself that they still lived  at such moments vengeance  that 
burned within me  died in my heart  and i pursued my path towards the 
destruction of the d  mon more as a task enjoined by heaven  as the 
mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious  than as the 
ardent desire of my soul  
 
what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know  sometimes  indeed  he 
left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided 
me and instigated my fury     my reign is not yet 
over      these words were legible in one of these 
inscriptions      you live  and my power is complete  follow me  i 
seek the everlasting ices of the north  where you will feel the misery of 
cold and frost  to which i am impassive  you will find near this place  if 
you follow not too tardily  a dead hare  eat and be refreshed  come on  my 
enemy  we have yet to wrestle for our lives  but many hard and miserable 
hours must you endure until that period shall arrive     
 
scoffing devil  again do i vow vengeance  again do i devote thee  
miserable fiend  to torture and death  never will i give up my search 
until he or i perish  and then with what ecstasy shall i join my 
elizabeth and my departed friends  who even now prepare for me the 
reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage  
 
as i still pursued my journey to the northward  the snows thickened and the 
cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support  the peasants were 
shut up in their hovels  and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to 
seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to 
seek for prey  the rivers were covered with ice  and no fish could be 
procured  and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance  
 
the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours  one 
inscription that he left was in these words     prepare  your toils 
only begin  wrap yourself in furs and provide food  for we shall soon enter 
upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting 
hatred     
 
my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words  i 
resolved not to fail in my purpose  and calling on heaven to support 
me  i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts  
until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary 
of the horizon  oh  how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the 
south  covered with ice  it was only to be distinguished from land by 
its superior wildness and ruggedness  the greeks wept for joy when 
they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia  and hailed with 
rapture the boundary of their toils  i did not weep  but i knelt down 
and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in 
safety to the place where i hoped  notwithstanding my adversary   s gibe  
to meet and grapple with him  
 
some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus 
traversed the snows with inconceivable speed  i know not whether the 
fiend possessed the same advantages  but i found that  as before i had 
daily lost ground in the pursuit  i now gained on him  so much so that 
when i first saw the ocean he was but one day   s journey in advance  and 
i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach  with new 
courage  therefore  i pressed on  and in two days arrived at a wretched 
hamlet on the seashore  i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the 
fiend and gained accurate information  a gigantic monster  they said  
had arrived the night before  armed with a gun and many pistols  
putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of 
his terrific appearance  he had carried off their store of winter 
food  and placing it in a sledge  to draw which he had seized on a 
numerous drove of trained dogs  he had harnessed them  and the same 
night  to the joy of the horror-struck villagers  had pursued his 
journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land  and they 
conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the 
ice or frozen by the eternal frosts  
 
on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair  
he had escaped me  and i must commence a destructive and almost endless 
journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean  amidst cold that few 
of the inhabitants could long endure and which i  the native of a 
genial and sunny climate  could not hope to survive  yet at the idea 
that the fiend should live and be triumphant  my rage and vengeance 
returned  and like a mighty tide  overwhelmed every other feeling  
after a slight repose  during which the spirits of the dead hovered 
round and instigated me to toil and revenge  i prepared for my journey  
 
i exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of 
the frozen ocean  and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions  i 
departed from land  
 
i cannot guess how many days have passed since then  but i have endured 
misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution 
burning within my heart could have enabled me to support  immense and 
rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage  and i often heard 
the thunder of the ground sea  which threatened my destruction  but 
again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure  
 
by the quantity of provision which i had consumed  i should guess that 
i had passed three weeks in this journey  and the continual protraction 
of hope  returning back upon the heart  often wrung bitter drops of 
despondency and grief from my eyes  despair had indeed almost secured 
her prey  and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery  once  after 
the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the 
summit of a sloping ice mountain  and one  sinking under his fatigue  
died  i viewed the expanse before me with anguish  when suddenly my eye 
caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain  i strained my sight to 
discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i 
distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known 
form within  oh  with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart  
warm tears filled my eyes  which i hastily wiped away  that they might 
not intercept the view i had of the d  mon  but still my sight was 
dimmed by the burning drops  until  giving way to the emotions that 
oppressed me  i wept aloud  
 
but this was not the time for delay  i disencumbered the dogs of their 
dead companion  gave them a plentiful portion of food  and after an 
hour   s rest  which was absolutely necessary  and yet which was bitterly 
irksome to me  i continued my route  the sledge was still visible  nor 
did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short 
time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags  i indeed 
perceptibly gained on it  and when  after nearly two days    journey  i 
beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant  my heart bounded within 
me  
 
but now  when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe  my hopes were 
suddenly extinguished  and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had 
ever done before  a ground sea was heard  the thunder of its progress  as 
the waters rolled and swelled beneath me  became every moment more ominous 
and terrific  i pressed on  but in vain  the wind arose  the sea roared  
and  as with the mighty shock of an earthquake  it split and cracked with a 
tremendous and overwhelming sound  the work was soon finished  in a few 
minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy  and i was left 
drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and 
thus preparing for me a hideous death  
 
in this manner many appalling hours passed  several of my dogs died  and i 
myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your 
vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life  
i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded 
at the sight  i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars  and 
by these means was enabled  with infinite fatigue  to move my ice raft in 
the direction of your ship  i had determined  if you were going southwards  
still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my 
purpose  i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue 
my enemy  but your direction was northwards  you took me on board when my 
vigour was exhausted  and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied 
hardships into a death which i still dread  for my task is unfulfilled  
 
oh  when will my guiding spirit  in conducting me to the d  mon  allow 
me the rest i so much desire  or must i die  and he yet live  if i do  
swear to me  walton  that he shall not escape  that you will seek him 
and satisfy my vengeance in his death  and do i dare to ask of you to 
undertake my pilgrimage  to endure the hardships that i have undergone  
no  i am not so selfish  yet  when i am dead  if he should appear  if 
the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you  swear that he 
shall not live   swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated 
woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes  he is eloquent 
and persuasive  and once his words had even power over my heart  but 
trust him not  his soul is as hellish as his form  full of treachery 
and fiend-like malice  hear him not  call on the names of william  
justine  clerval  elizabeth  my father  and of the wretched victor  and 
thrust your sword into his heart  i will hover near and direct the 
steel aright

august 26th  17     
 
 
you have read this strange and terrific story  margaret  and do you not 
feel your blood congeal with horror  like that which even now curdles 
mine  sometimes  seized with sudden agony  he could not continue his 
tale  at others  his voice broken  yet piercing  uttered with 
difficulty the words so replete with anguish  his fine and lovely eyes 
were now lighted up with indignation  now subdued to downcast sorrow 
and quenched in infinite wretchedness  sometimes he commanded his 
countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a 
tranquil voice  suppressing every mark of agitation  then  like a 
volcano bursting forth  his face would suddenly change to an expression 
of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor  
 
his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth  
yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie  which he showed me  
and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship  brought to me a 
greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations  
however earnest and connected  such a monster has  then  really existence  
i cannot doubt it  yet i am lost in surprise and admiration  sometimes i 
endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his 
creature   s formation  but on this point he was impenetrable  
 
   are you mad  my friend     said he     or whither does your 
senseless curiosity lead you  would you also create for yourself and the 
world a demoniacal enemy  peace  peace  learn my miseries and do not seek 
to increase your own     
 
frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history  he asked 
to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places  
but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held 
with his enemy     since you have preserved my narration     said 
he     i would not that a mutilated one should go down to 
posterity     
 
thus has a week passed away  while i have listened to the strangest 
tale that ever imagination formed  my thoughts and every feeling of my 
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale 
and his own elevated and gentle manners have created  i wish to soothe 
him  yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable  so destitute of 
every hope of consolation  to live  oh  no  the only joy that he can 
now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and 
death  yet he enjoys one comfort  the offspring of solitude and 
delirium  he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his 
friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or 
excitements to his vengeance  that they are not the creations of his 
fancy  but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a 
remote world  this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render 
them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth  
 
our conversations are not always confined to his own history and 
misfortunes  on every point of general literature he displays 
unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension  his 
eloquence is forcible and touching  nor can i hear him  when he relates 
a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love  
without tears  what a glorious creature must he have been in the days 
of his prosperity  when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin  he seems 
to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall  
 
   when younger     said he     i believed myself destined for 
some great enterprise  my feelings are profound  but i possessed a coolness 
of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements  this sentiment of 
the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed  
for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that 
might be useful to my fellow creatures  when i reflected on the work i had 
completed  no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational 
animal  i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors  but 
this thought  which supported me in the commencement of my career  now 
serves only to plunge me lower in the dust  all my speculations and hopes 
are as nothing  and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence  i am 
chained in an eternal hell  my imagination was vivid  yet my powers of 
analysis and application were intense  by the union of these qualities i 
conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man  even now i cannot 
recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete  i trod 
heaven in my thoughts  now exulting in my powers  now burning with the idea 
of their effects  from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty 
ambition  but how am i sunk  oh  my friend  if you had known me as i once 
was  you would not recognise me in this state of degradation  despondency 
rarely visited my heart  a high destiny seemed to bear me on  until i fell  
never  never again to rise     
 
must i then lose this admirable being  i have longed for a friend  i have 
sought one who would sympathise with and love me  behold  on these desert 
seas i have found such a one  but i fear i have gained him only to know his 
value and lose him  i would reconcile him to life  but he repulses the idea  
 
   i thank you  walton     he said     for your kind intentions towards so 
miserable a wretch  but when you speak of new ties and fresh 
affections  think you that any can replace those who are gone  can any 
man be to me as clerval was  or any woman another elizabeth  even 
where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence  
the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our 
minds which hardly any later friend can obtain  they know our 
infantine dispositions  which  however they may be afterwards modified  
are never eradicated  and they can judge of our actions with more 
certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives  a sister or a 
brother can never  unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early  
suspect the other of fraud or false dealing  when another friend  
however strongly he may be attached  may  in spite of himself  be 
contemplated with suspicion  but i enjoyed friends  dear not only 
through habit and association  but from their own merits  and wherever 
i am  the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of 
clerval will be ever whispered in my ear  they are dead  and but one 
feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life  if i 
were engaged in any high undertaking or design  fraught with extensive 
utility to my fellow creatures  then could i live to fulfil it  but 
such is not my destiny  i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i 
gave existence  then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die     
 
my beloved sister  
 
september 2d  
 
 
i write to you  encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever 
doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit 
it  i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and 
threaten every moment to crush my vessel  the brave fellows whom i 
have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid  but i have 
none to bestow  there is something terribly appalling in our 
situation  yet my courage and hopes do not desert me  yet it is 
terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered 
through me  if we are lost  my mad schemes are the cause  
 
and what  margaret  will be the state of your mind  you will not hear of my 
destruction  and you will anxiously await my return  years will pass  and 
you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope  oh  my 
beloved sister  the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is  
in prospect  more terrible to me than my own death  but you have a husband 
and lovely children  you may be happy  heaven bless you and make you so  
 
my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion  he 
endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession 
which he valued  he reminds me how often the same accidents have 
happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea  and in spite 
of myself  he fills me with cheerful auguries  even the sailors feel 
the power of his eloquence  when he speaks  they no longer despair  he 
rouses their energies  and while they hear his voice they believe these 
vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the 
resolutions of man  these feelings are transitory  each day of 
expectation delayed fills them with fear  and i almost dread a mutiny 
caused by this despair  
 
september 5th  
 
 
a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that  although it is 
highly probable that these papers may never reach you  yet i cannot 
forbear recording it  
 
we are still surrounded by mountains of ice  still in imminent danger 
of being crushed in their conflict  the cold is excessive  and many of 
my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of 
desolation  frankenstein has daily declined in health  a feverish fire 
still glimmers in his eyes  but he is exhausted  and when suddenly 
roused to any exertion  he speedily sinks again into apparent 
lifelessness  
 
i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny  
this morning  as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend   his 
eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly   i was roused by half 
a dozen of the sailors  who demanded admission into the cabin  they 
entered  and their leader addressed me  he told me that he and his 
companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation 
to me to make me a requisition which  in justice  i could not refuse  
we were immured in ice and should probably never escape  but they 
feared that if  as was possible  the ice should dissipate and a free 
passage be opened  i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and 
lead them into fresh dangers  after they might happily have surmounted 
this  they insisted  therefore  that i should engage with a solemn 
promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my 
course southwards  
 
this speech troubled me  i had not despaired  nor had i yet conceived 
the idea of returning if set free  yet could i  in justice  or even in 
possibility  refuse this demand  i hesitated before i answered  when 
frankenstein  who had at first been silent  and indeed appeared hardly 
to have force enough to attend  now roused himself  his eyes sparkled  
and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour  turning towards the men  
he said  
 
   what do you mean  what do you demand of your captain  are you  then  
so easily turned from your design  did you not call this a glorious 
expedition     and wherefore was it glorious  not because the way was 
smooth and placid as a southern sea  but because it was full of dangers and 
terror  because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth 
and your courage exhibited  because danger and death surrounded it  and 
these you were to brave and overcome  for this was it a glorious  for this 
was it an honourable undertaking  you were hereafter to be hailed as the 
benefactors of your species  your names adored as belonging to brave men 
who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind  and now  
behold  with the first imagination of danger  or  if you will  the first 
mighty and terrific trial of your courage  you shrink away and are content 
to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and 
peril  and so  poor souls  they were chilly and returned to their warm 
firesides  why  that requires not this preparation  ye need not have come 
thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove 
yourselves cowards  oh  be men  or be more than men  be steady to your 
purposes and firm as a rock  this ice is not made of such stuff as your 
hearts may be  it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it 
shall not  do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace 
marked on your brows  return as heroes who have fought and conquered and 
who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe     
 
he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed 
in his speech  with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism  that can 
you wonder that these men were moved  they looked at one another and were 
unable to reply  i spoke  i told them to retire and consider of what had 
been said  that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously 
desired the contrary  but that i hoped that  with reflection  their courage 
would return  
 
they retired and i turned towards my friend  but he was sunk in languor and 
almost deprived of life  
 
how all this will terminate  i know not  but i had rather die than 
return shamefully  my purpose unfulfilled  yet i fear such will be my 
fate  the men  unsupported by ideas of glory and honour  can never 
willingly continue to endure their present hardships  
 
september 7th  
 
 
the die is cast  i have consented to return if we are not destroyed  
thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision  i come back 
ignorant and disappointed  it requires more philosophy than i possess 
to bear this injustice with patience  
 
september 12th  
 
 
it is past  i am returning to england  i have lost my hopes of utility 
and glory  i have lost my friend  but i will endeavour to detail these 
bitter circumstances to you  my dear sister  and while i am wafted 
towards england and towards you  i will not despond  
 
september 9th  the ice began to move  and roarings like thunder were heard 
at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction  we were 
in the most imminent peril  but as we could only remain passive  my chief 
attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in 
such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed  the ice cracked 
behind us and was driven with force towards the north  a breeze sprang from 
the west  and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly 
free  when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native 
country was apparently assured  a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them  
loud and long-continued  frankenstein  who was dozing  awoke and asked the 
cause of the tumult     they shout     i said     because they 
will soon return to england     
 
   do you  then  really return     
 
   alas  yes  i cannot withstand their demands  i cannot lead them 
unwillingly to danger  and i must return     
 
   do so  if you will  but i will not  you may give up your purpose  but 
mine is assigned to me by heaven  and i dare not  i am weak  but 
surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with 
sufficient strength     saying this  he endeavoured to spring from the 
bed  but the exertion was too great for him  he fell back and fainted  
 
it was long before he was restored  and i often thought that life was 
entirely extinct  at length he opened his eyes  he breathed with 
difficulty and was unable to speak  the surgeon gave him a composing 
draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed  in the meantime he 
told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live  
 
his sentence was pronounced  and i could only grieve and be patient  i sat 
by his bed  watching him  his eyes were closed  and i thought he slept  but 
presently he called to me in a feeble voice  and bidding me come near  
said     alas  the strength i relied on is gone  i feel that i shall 
soon die  and he  my enemy and persecutor  may still be in being  think 
not  walton  that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning 
hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed  but i feel myself 
justified in desiring the death of my adversary  during these last days i 
have been occupied in examining my past conduct  nor do i find it blamable  
in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was 
bound towards him to assure  as far as was in my power  his happiness and 
well-being  this was my duty  but there was another still paramount to 
that  my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to 
my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or 
misery  urged by this view  i refused  and i did right in refusing  to 
create a companion for the first creature  he showed unparalleled malignity 
and selfishness in evil  he destroyed my friends  he devoted to destruction 
beings who possessed exquisite sensations  happiness  and wisdom  nor do i 
know where this thirst for vengeance may end  miserable himself that he may 
render no other wretched  he ought to die  the task of his destruction was 
mine  but i have failed  when actuated by selfish and vicious motives  i 
asked you to undertake my unfinished work  and i renew this request now  
when i am only induced by reason and virtue  
 
   yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil 
this task  and now that you are returning to england  you will have 
little chance of meeting with him  but the consideration of these 
points  and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties  i 
leave to you  my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near 
approach of death  i dare not ask you to do what i think right  for i 
may still be misled by passion  
 
   that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me  in 
other respects  this hour  when i momentarily expect my release  is the 
only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years  the forms of 
the beloved dead flit before me  and i hasten to their arms  farewell  
walton  seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition  even if it 
be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in 
science and discoveries  yet why do i say this  i have myself been 
blasted in these hopes  yet another may succeed     
 
his voice became fainter as he spoke  and at length  exhausted by his 
effort  he sank into silence  about half an hour afterwards he 
attempted again to speak but was unable  he pressed my hand feebly  and 
his eyes closed for ever  while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed 
away from his lips  
 
margaret  what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this 
glorious spirit  what can i say that will enable you to understand the 
depth of my sorrow  all that i should express would be inadequate and 
feeble  my tears flow  my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of 
disappointment  but i journey towards england  and i may there find 
consolation  
 
i am interrupted  what do these sounds portend  it is midnight  the 
breeze blows fairly  and the watch on deck scarcely stir  again there 
is a sound as of a human voice  but hoarser  it comes from the cabin 
where the remains of frankenstein still lie  i must arise and examine  
good night  my sister  
 
great god  what a scene has just taken place  i am yet dizzy with the 
remembrance of it  i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail 
it  yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this 
final and wonderful catastrophe  
 
i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable 
friend  over him hung a form which i cannot find words to 
describe   gigantic in stature  yet uncouth and distorted in its 
proportions  as he hung over the coffin  his face was concealed by long 
locks of ragged hair  but one vast hand was extended  in colour and 
apparent texture like that of a mummy  when he heard the sound of my 
approach  he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung 
towards the window  never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face  of 
such loathsome yet appalling hideousness  i shut my eyes involuntarily and 
endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer  
i called on him to stay  
 
he paused  looking on me with wonder  and again turning towards the 
lifeless form of his creator  he seemed to forget my presence  and 
every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some 
uncontrollable passion  
 
   that is also my victim     he exclaimed     in his murder my 
crimes are consummated  the miserable series of my being is wound to its 
close  oh  frankenstein  generous and self-devoted being  what does it 
avail that i now ask thee to pardon me  i  who irretrievably destroyed thee 
by destroying all thou lovedst  alas  he is cold  he cannot answer 
me     
 
his voice seemed suffocated  and my first impulses  which had suggested to 
me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his 
enemy  were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion  i 
approached this tremendous being  i dared not again raise my eyes to his 
face  there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness  i 
attempted to speak  but the words died away on my lips  the monster 
continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches  at length i 
gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion  
 
   your repentance     i said     is now superfluous  if you 
had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse 
before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity  
frankenstein would yet have lived     
 
   and do you dream     said the d  mon     do you think that i was then 
dead to agony and remorse  he     he continued  pointing to the corpse  
   he suffered not in the consummation of the deed  oh  not the 
ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the 
lingering detail of its execution  a frightful selfishness hurried me 
on  while my heart was poisoned with remorse  think you that the 
groans of clerval were music to my ears  my heart was fashioned to be 
susceptible of love and sympathy  and when wrenched by misery to vice 
and hatred  it did not endure the violence of the change without 
torture such as you cannot even imagine  
 
   after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland  heart-broken 
and overcome  i pitied frankenstein  my pity amounted to horror  i 
abhorred myself  but when i discovered that he  the author at once of 
my existence and of its unspeakable torments  dared to hope for 
happiness  that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me 
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the 
indulgence of which i was for ever barred  then impotent envy and bitter 
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance  i 
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished  i 
knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture  but i was the 
slave  not the master  of an impulse which i detested yet could not 
disobey  yet when she died  nay  then i was not miserable  i had 
cast off all feeling  subdued all anguish  to riot in the excess of my 
despair  evil thenceforth became my good  urged thus far  i had no 
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly 
chosen  the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable 
passion  and now it is ended  there is my last victim     
 
i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery  yet  when i called 
to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and 
persuasion  and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my 
friend  indignation was rekindled within me     wretch     i said  
   it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you 
have made  you throw a torch into a pile of buildings  and when they are 
consumed  you sit among the ruins and lament the fall  hypocritical fiend  
if he whom you mourn still lived  still would he be the object  again would 
he become the prey  of your accursed vengeance  it is not pity that you 
feel  you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn 
from your power     
 
   oh  it is not thus   not thus     interrupted the being  
   yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to 
be the purport of my actions  yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery  
no sympathy may i ever find  when i first sought it  it was the love of 
virtue  the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being 
overflowed  that i wished to be participated  but now that virtue has 
become to me a shadow  and that happiness and affection are turned into 
bitter and loathing despair  in what should i seek for sympathy  i am 
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure  when i die  i am 
well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory  once 
my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue  of fame  and of enjoyment  once 
i falsely hoped to meet with beings who  pardoning my outward form  would 
love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding  i was 
nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion  but now crime has 
degraded me beneath the meanest animal  no guilt  no mischief  no 
malignity  no misery  can be found comparable to mine  when i run over the 
frightful catalogue of my sins  i cannot believe that i am the same 
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent 
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness  but it is even so  the 
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil  yet even that enemy of god and man 
had friends and associates in his desolation  i am alone  
 
   you  who call frankenstein your friend  seem to have a knowledge of my 
crimes and his misfortunes  but in the detail which he gave you of them 
he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured 
wasting in impotent passions  for while i destroyed his hopes  i did 
not satisfy my own desires  they were for ever ardent and craving  still 
i desired love and fellowship  and i was still spurned  was there no 
injustice in this  am i to be thought the only criminal  when all 
humankind sinned against me  why do you not hate felix  who drove his 
friend from his door with contumely  why do you not execrate the rustic 
who sought to destroy the saviour of his child  nay  these are virtuous 
and immaculate beings  i  the miserable and the abandoned  am an 
abortion  to be spurned at  and kicked  and trampled on  even now my 
blood boils at the recollection of this injustice  
 
   but it is true that i am a wretch  i have murdered the lovely and 
the helpless  i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to 
death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing  i have 
devoted my creator  the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and 
admiration among men  to misery  i have pursued him even to that 
irremediable ruin  there he lies  white and cold in death  you hate me  but 
your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself  i look on the 
hands which executed the deed  i think on the heart in which the 
imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands 
will meet my eyes  when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more  
 
   fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief  my work 
is nearly complete  neither yours nor any man   s death is needed to 
consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done  
but it requires my own  do not think that i shall be slow to perform this 
sacrifice  i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me 
thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe  i shall 
collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame  that its 
remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would 
create such another as i have been  i shall die  i shall no longer feel the 
agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied  yet 
unquenched  he is dead who called me into being  and when i shall be no 
more  the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish  i shall no 
longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks  light  
feeling  and sense will pass away  and in this condition must i find my 
happiness  some years ago  when the images which this world affords first 
opened upon me  when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the 
rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds  and these were all to 
me  i should have wept to die  now it is my only consolation  polluted by 
crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse  where can i find rest but in 
death  
 
   farewell  i leave you  and in you the last of humankind whom these 
eyes will ever behold  farewell  frankenstein  if thou wert yet alive 
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me  it would be better 
satiated in my life than in my destruction  but it was not so  thou 
didst seek my extinction  that i might not cause greater wretchedness  
and if yet  in some mode unknown to me  thou hadst not ceased to think 
and feel  thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than 
that which i feel  blasted as thou wert  my agony was still superior to 
thine  for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my 
wounds until death shall close them for ever  
 
   but soon     he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm     i 
shall die  and what i now feel be no longer felt  soon these burning 
miseries will be extinct  i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and 
exult in the agony of the torturing flames  the light of that conflagration 
will fade away  my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds  my spirit 
will sleep in peace  or if it thinks  it will not surely think thus  
farewell     
 
he sprang from the cabin-window as he said this  upon the ice raft 
which lay close to the vessel  he was soon borne away by the waves and 
lost in darkness and distance
