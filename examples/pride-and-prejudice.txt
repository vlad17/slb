      chapter 1 
 
      it is a truth universally acknowledged  that a single man in 
      possession of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife  
 
      however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be 
      on his first entering a neighbourhood  this truth is so well 
      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families  that he is 
      considered the rightful property of some one or other of their 
      daughters  
 
         my dear mr  bennet     said his lady to him one day     have you 
      heard that netherfield park is let at last     
 
      mr  bennet replied that he had not  
 
         but it is     returned she     for mrs  long has just been here  and 
      she told me all about it     
 
      mr  bennet made no answer  
 
         do you not want to know who has taken it     cried his wife 
      impatiently  
 
          you  want to tell me  and i have no objection to hearing it     
 
      this was invitation enough  
 
         why  my dear  you must know  mrs  long says that netherfield is 
      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england  
      that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the 
      place  and was so much delighted with it  that he agreed with mr  
      morris immediately  that he is to take possession before 
      michaelmas  and some of his servants are to be in the house by 
      the end of next week     
 
         what is his name     
 
         bingley     
 
         is he married or single     
 
         oh  single  my dear  to be sure  a single man of large fortune  
      four or five thousand a year  what a fine thing for our girls     
 
         how so  how can it affect them     
 
         my dear mr  bennet     replied his wife     how can you be so 
      tiresome  you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of 
      them     
 
         is that his design in settling here     
 
         design  nonsense  how can you talk so  but it is very likely 
      that he  may  fall in love with one of them  and therefore you 
      must visit him as soon as he comes     
 
         i see no occasion for that  you and the girls may go  or you may 
      send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for 
      as you are as handsome as any of them  mr  bingley may like you 
      the best of the party     
 
         my dear  you flatter me  i certainly  have  had my share of 
      beauty  but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now  
      when a woman has five grown-up daughters  she ought to give over 
      thinking of her own beauty     
 
         in such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of     
 
         but  my dear  you must indeed go and see mr  bingley when he 
      comes into the neighbourhood     
 
         it is more than i engage for  i assure you     
 
         but consider your daughters  only think what an establishment it 
      would be for one of them  sir william and lady lucas are 
      determined to go  merely on that account  for in general  you 
      know  they visit no newcomers  indeed you must go  for it will be 
      impossible for  us  to visit him if you do not     
 
         you are over-scrupulous  surely  i dare say mr  bingley will be 
      very glad to see you  and i will send a few lines by you to 
      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he 
      chooses of the girls  though i must throw in a good word for my 
      little lizzy     
 
         i desire you will do no such thing  lizzy is not a bit better 
      than the others  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as 
      jane  nor half so good-humoured as lydia  but you are always 
      giving  her  the preference     
 
         they have none of them much to recommend them     replied he  
         they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  but lizzy has 
      something more of quickness than her sisters     
 
         mr  bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way  
      you take delight in vexing me  you have no compassion for my poor 
      nerves     
 
         you mistake me  my dear  i have a high respect for your nerves  
      they are my old friends  i have heard you mention them with 
      consideration these last twenty years at least     
 
         ah  you do not know what i suffer     
 
         but i hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men 
      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood     
 
         it will be no use to us  if twenty such should come  since you 
      will not visit them     
 
         depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  i will 
      visit them all     
 
      mr  bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour  
      reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three-and-twenty 
      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his 
      character   her  mind was less difficult to develop  she was a 
      woman of mean understanding  little information  and uncertain 
      temper  when she was discontented  she fancied herself nervous  
      the business of her life was to get her daughters married  its 
      solace was visiting and news  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 2 
 
      mr  bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr  
      bingley  he had always intended to visit him  though to the last 
      always assuring his wife that he should not go  and till the 
      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it  it 
      was then disclosed in the following manner  observing his second 
      daughter employed in trimming a hat  he suddenly addressed her 
      with  
 
         i hope mr  bingley will like it  lizzy     
 
         we are not in a way to know  what  mr  bingley likes     said her 
      mother resentfully     since we are not to visit     
 
         but you forget  mamma     said elizabeth     that we shall meet him 
      at the assemblies  and that mrs  long promised to introduce him     
 
         i do not believe mrs  long will do any such thing  she has two 
      nieces of her own  she is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and i 
      have no opinion of her     
 
         no more have i     said mr  bennet     and i am glad to find that 
      you do not depend on her serving you     
 
      mrs  bennet deigned not to make any reply  but  unable to contain 
      herself  began scolding one of her daughters  
 
         don   t keep coughing so  kitty  for heaven   s sake  have a little 
      compassion on my nerves  you tear them to pieces     
 
         kitty has no discretion in her coughs     said her father     she 
      times them ill     
 
         i do not cough for my own amusement     replied kitty fretfully  
         when is your next ball to be  lizzy     
 
         to-morrow fortnight     
 
         aye  so it is     cried her mother     and mrs  long does not come 
      back till the day before  so it will be impossible for her to 
      introduce him  for she will not know him herself     
 
         then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and 
      introduce mr  bingley to  her      
 
         impossible  mr  bennet  impossible  when i am not acquainted 
      with him myself  how can you be so teasing     
 
         i honour your circumspection  a fortnight   s acquaintance is 
      certainly very little  one cannot know what a man really is by 
      the end of a fortnight  but if  we  do not venture somebody else 
      will  and after all  mrs  long and her nieces must stand their 
      chance  and  therefore  as she will think it an act of kindness  
      if you decline the office  i will take it on myself     
 
      the girls stared at their father  mrs  bennet said only  
         nonsense  nonsense     
 
         what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation     cried he  
         do you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that 
      is laid on them  as nonsense  i cannot quite agree with you 
       there   what say you  mary  for you are a young lady of deep 
      reflection  i know  and read great books and make extracts     
 
      mary wished to say something sensible  but knew not how  
 
         while mary is adjusting her ideas     he continued     let us return 
      to mr  bingley     
 
         i am sick of mr  bingley     cried his wife  
 
         i am sorry to hear  that   but why did not you tell me that 
      before  if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not 
      have called on him  it is very unlucky  but as i have actually 
      paid the visit  we cannot escape the acquaintance now     
 
      the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  that of 
      mrs  bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though  when the first 
      tumult of joy was over  she began to declare that it was what she 
      had expected all the while  
 
         how good it was in you  my dear mr  bennet  but i knew i should 
      persuade you at last  i was sure you loved your girls too well to 
      neglect such an acquaintance  well  how pleased i am  and it is 
      such a good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning and 
      never said a word about it till now     
 
         now  kitty  you may cough as much as you choose     said mr  
      bennet  and  as he spoke  he left the room  fatigued with the 
      raptures of his wife  
 
         what an excellent father you have  girls     said she  when the 
      door was shut     i do not know how you will ever make him amends 
      for his kindness  or me  either  for that matter  at our time of 
      life it is not so pleasant  i can tell you  to be making new 
      acquaintances every day  but for your sakes  we would do 
      anything  lydia  my love  though you  are  the youngest  i dare 
      say mr  bingley will dance with you at the next ball     
 
         oh     said lydia stoutly     i am not afraid  for though i  am  the 
      youngest  i   m the tallest     
 
      the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he 
      would return mr  bennet   s visit  and determining when they should 
      ask him to dinner  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 3 
 
      not all that mrs  bennet  however  with the assistance of her 
      five daughters  could ask on the subject  was sufficient to draw 
      from her husband any satisfactory description of mr  bingley  
      they attacked him in various ways   with barefaced questions  
      ingenious suppositions  and distant surmises  but he eluded the 
      skill of them all  and they were at last obliged to accept the 
      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour  lady lucas  her 
      report was highly favourable  sir william had been delighted with 
      him  he was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely 
      agreeable  and  to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next 
      assembly with a large party  nothing could be more delightful  to 
      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love  
      and very lively hopes of mr  bingley   s heart were entertained  
 
         if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at 
      netherfield     said mrs  bennet to her husband     and all the 
      others equally well married  i shall have nothing to wish for     
 
      in a few days mr  bingley returned mr  bennet   s visit  and sat 
      about ten minutes with him in his library  he had entertained 
      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose 
      beauty he had heard much  but he saw only the father  the ladies 
      were somewhat more fortunate  for they had the advantage of 
      ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat  and 
      rode a black horse  
 
      an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and 
      already had mrs  bennet planned the courses that were to do 
      credit to her housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred 
      it all  mr  bingley was obliged to be in town the following day  
      and  consequently  unable to accept the honour of their 
      invitation  etc  mrs  bennet was quite disconcerted  she could 
      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his 
      arrival in hertfordshire  and she began to fear that he might be 
      always flying about from one place to another  and never settled 
      at netherfield as he ought to be  lady lucas quieted her fears a 
      little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to 
      get a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that 
      mr  bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with 
      him to the assembly  the girls grieved over such a number of 
      ladies  but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing  
      that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from 
      london   his five sisters and a cousin  and when the party entered 
      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether   mr  
      bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and another 
      young man  
 
      mr  bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike  he had a pleasant 
      countenance  and easy  unaffected manners  his sisters were fine 
      women  with an air of decided fashion  his brother-in-law  mr  
      hurst  merely looked the gentleman  but his friend mr  darcy soon 
      drew the attention of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome 
      features  noble mien  and the report which was in general 
      circulation within five minutes after his entrance  of his having 
      ten thousand a year  the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine 
      figure of a man  the ladies declared he was much handsomer than 
      mr  bingley  and he was looked at with great admiration for about 
      half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust which turned 
      the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be proud  to 
      be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all his 
      large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most 
      forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be 
      compared with his friend  
 
      mr  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the 
      principal people in the room  he was lively and unreserved  
      danced every dance  was angry that the ball closed so early  and 
      talked of giving one himself at netherfield  such amiable 
      qualities must speak for themselves  what a contrast between him 
      and his friend  mr  darcy danced only once with mrs  hurst and 
      once with miss bingley  declined being introduced to any other 
      lady  and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the 
      room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party  his 
      character was decided  he was the proudest  most disagreeable man 
      in the world  and everybody hoped that he would never come there 
      again  amongst the most violent against him was mrs  bennet  
      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into 
      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her 
      daughters  
 
      elizabeth bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen  
      to sit down for two dances  and during part of that time  mr  
      darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a 
      conversation between him and mr  bingley  who came from the dance 
      for a few minutes  to press his friend to join it  
 
         come  darcy     said he     i must have you dance  i hate to see you 
      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner  you had much 
      better dance     
 
         i certainly shall not  you know how i detest it  unless i am 
      particularly acquainted with my partner  at such an assembly as 
      this it would be insupportable  your sisters are engaged  and 
      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a 
      punishment to me to stand up with     
 
         i would not be so fastidious as you are     cried mr  bingley  
         for a kingdom  upon my honour  i never met with so many pleasant 
      girls in my life as i have this evening  and there are several of 
      them you see uncommonly pretty     
 
          you  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room     said 
      mr  darcy  looking at the eldest miss bennet  
 
         oh  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld  but there 
      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very 
      pretty  and i dare say very agreeable  do let me ask my partner 
      to introduce you     
 
         which do you mean     and turning round he looked for a moment at 
      elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly 
      said     she is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt  me   i 
      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies 
      who are slighted by other men  you had better return to your 
      partner and enjoy her smiles  for you are wasting your time with 
      me     
 
      mr  bingley followed his advice  mr  darcy walked off  and 
      elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him  she 
      told the story  however  with great spirit among her friends  for 
      she had a lively  playful disposition  which delighted in 
      anything ridiculous  
 
      the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family  
      mrs  bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the 
      netherfield party  mr  bingley had danced with her twice  and she 
      had been distinguished by his sisters  jane was as much gratified 
      by this as her mother could be  though in a quieter way  
      elizabeth felt jane   s pleasure  mary had heard herself mentioned 
      to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the 
      neighbourhood  and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough 
      never to be without partners  which was all that they had yet 
      learnt to care for at a ball  they returned  therefore  in good 
      spirits to longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which 
      they were the principal inhabitants  they found mr  bennet still 
      up  with a book he was regardless of time  and on the present 
      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an 
      evening which had raised such splendid expectations  he had 
      rather hoped that his wife   s views on the stranger would be 
      disappointed  but he soon found out that he had a different story 
      to hear  
 
         oh  my dear mr  bennet     as she entered the room     we have had a 
      most delightful evening  a most excellent ball  i wish you had 
      been there  jane was so admired  nothing could be like it  
      everybody said how well she looked  and mr  bingley thought her 
      quite beautiful  and danced with her twice  only think of  that   
      my dear  he actually danced with her twice  and she was the only 
      creature in the room that he asked a second time  first of all  
      he asked miss lucas  i was so vexed to see him stand up with her  
      but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody can  
      you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going 
      down the dance  so he enquired who she was  and got introduced  
      and asked her for the two next  then the two third he danced with 
      miss king  and the two fourth with maria lucas  and the two fifth 
      with jane again  and the two sixth with lizzy  and the 
       boulanger        
 
         if he had had any compassion for  me      cried her husband 
      impatiently     he would not have danced half so much  for god   s 
      sake  say no more of his partners  oh that he had sprained his 
      ankle in the first dance     
 
         oh  my dear  i am quite delighted with him  he is so excessively 
      handsome  and his sisters are charming women  i never in my life 
      saw anything more elegant than their dresses  i dare say the lace 
      upon mrs  hurst   s gown       
 
      here she was interrupted again  mr  bennet protested against any 
      description of finery  she was therefore obliged to seek another 
      branch of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of 
      spirit and some exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr  darcy  
 
         but i can assure you     she added     that lizzy does not lose much 
      by not suiting  his  fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid 
      man  not at all worth pleasing  so high and so conceited that 
      there was no enduring him  he walked here  and he walked there  
      fancying himself so very great  not handsome enough to dance 
      with  i wish you had been there  my dear  to have given him one 
      of your set-downs  i quite detest the man     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 4 
 
      when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been 
      cautious in her praise of mr  bingley before  expressed to her 
      sister just how very much she admired him  
 
         he is just what a young man ought to be     said she     sensible  
      good-humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners    so 
      much ease  with such perfect good breeding     
 
         he is also handsome     replied elizabeth     which a young man 
      ought likewise to be  if he possibly can  his character is 
      thereby complete     
 
         i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second 
      time  i did not expect such a compliment     
 
         did not you   i  did for you  but that is one great difference 
      between us  compliments always take  you  by surprise  and  me  
      never  what could be more natural than his asking you again  he 
      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as 
      every other woman in the room  no thanks to his gallantry for 
      that  well  he certainly is very agreeable  and i give you leave 
      to like him  you have liked many a stupider person     
 
         dear lizzy     
 
         oh  you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in 
      general  you never see a fault in anybody  all the world are good 
      and agreeable in your eyes  i never heard you speak ill of a 
      human being in your life     
 
         i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone  but i always 
      speak what i think     
 
         i know you do  and it is  that  which makes the wonder  with 
       your  good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and 
      nonsense of others  affectation of candour is common enough   one 
      meets with it everywhere  but to be candid without ostentation or 
      design   to take the good of everybody   s character and make it 
      still better  and say nothing of the bad   belongs to you alone  
      and so you like this man   s sisters  too  do you  their manners 
      are not equal to his     
 
         certainly not   at first  but they are very pleasing women when 
      you converse with them  miss bingley is to live with her brother  
      and keep his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a 
      very charming neighbour in her     
 
      elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their 
      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in 
      general  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy 
      of temper than her sister  and with a judgement too unassailed by 
      any attention to herself  she was very little disposed to approve 
      them  they were in fact very fine ladies  not deficient in good 
      humour when they were pleased  nor in the power of making 
      themselves agreeable when they chose it  but proud and conceited  
      they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the first 
      private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand 
      pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and 
      of associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every 
      respect entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of 
      others  they were of a respectable family in the north of 
      england  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories 
      than that their brother   s fortune and their own had been acquired 
      by trade  
 
      mr  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred 
      thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an 
      estate  but did not live to do it  mr  bingley intended it 
      likewise  and sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was 
      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor  it was 
      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his 
      temper  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at 
      netherfield  and leave the next generation to purchase  
 
      his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own  
      but  though he was now only established as a tenant  miss bingley 
      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table   nor was mrs  
      hurst  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune  less 
      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her  
      mr  bingley had not been of age two years  when he was tempted by 
      an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house  he did 
      look at it  and into it for half-an-hour   was pleased with the 
      situation and the principal rooms  satisfied with what the owner 
      said in its praise  and took it immediately  
 
      between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship  in 
      spite of great opposition of character  bingley was endeared to 
      darcy by the easiness  openness  and ductility of his temper  
      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own  
      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied  on the 
      strength of darcy   s regard  bingley had the firmest reliance  and 
      of his judgement the highest opinion  in understanding  darcy was 
      the superior  bingley was by no means deficient  but darcy was 
      clever  he was at the same time haughty  reserved  and 
      fastidious  and his manners  though well-bred  were not inviting  
      in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage  bingley was 
      sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually 
      giving offense  
 
      the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was 
      sufficiently characteristic  bingley had never met with more 
      pleasant people or prettier girls in his life  everybody had been 
      most kind and attentive to him  there had been no formality  no 
      stiffness  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  and  as 
      to miss bennet  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful  
      darcy  on the contrary  had seen a collection of people in whom 
      there was little beauty and no fashion  for none of whom he had 
      felt the smallest interest  and from none received either 
      attention or pleasure  miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty  
      but she smiled too much  
 
      mrs  hurst and her sister allowed it to be so   but still they 
      admired her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl  
      and one whom they would not object to know more of  miss bennet 
      was therefore established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt 
      authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 5 
 
      within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the 
      bennets were particularly intimate  sir william lucas had been 
      formerly in trade in meryton  where he had made a tolerable 
      fortune  and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to 
      the king during his mayoralty  the distinction had perhaps been 
      felt too strongly  it had given him a disgust to his business  
      and to his residence in a small market town  and  in quitting 
      them both  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile 
      from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge  where he 
      could think with pleasure of his own importance  and  unshackled 
      by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the 
      world  for  though elated by his rank  it did not render him 
      supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to everybody  
      by nature inoffensive  friendly  and obliging  his presentation 
      at st  james   s had made him courteous  
 
      lady lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a 
      valuable neighbour to mrs  bennet  they had several children  the 
      eldest of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about 
      twenty-seven  was elizabeth   s intimate friend  
 
      that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk 
      over a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the 
      assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to 
      communicate  
 
          you  began the evening well  charlotte     said mrs  bennet with 
      civil self-command to miss lucas      you  were mr  bingley   s first 
      choice     
 
         yes  but he seemed to like his second better     
 
         oh  you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice  
      to be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her   indeed i rather 
      believe he  did    i heard something about it   but i hardly know 
      what   something about mr  robinson     
 
         perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr  robinson  
      did not i mention it to you  mr  robinson   s asking him how he 
      liked our meryton assemblies  and whether he did not think there 
      were a great many pretty women in the room  and  which  he 
      thought the prettiest  and his answering immediately to the last 
      question     oh  the eldest miss bennet  beyond a doubt  there 
      cannot be two opinions on that point        
 
         upon my word  well  that is very decided indeed   that does seem 
      as if   but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know     
 
          my  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   eliza     
      said charlotte     mr  darcy is not so well worth listening to as 
      his friend  is he    poor eliza    to be only just  tolerable      
 
         i beg you would not put it into lizzy   s head to be vexed by his 
      ill-treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man  that it would 
      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him  mrs  long told me last 
      night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once 
      opening his lips     
 
         are you quite sure  ma   am    is not there a little mistake     said 
      jane     i certainly saw mr  darcy speaking to her     
 
         aye   because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and 
      he could not help answering her  but she said he seemed quite 
      angry at being spoke to     
 
         miss bingley told me     said jane     that he never speaks much  
      unless among his intimate acquaintances  with  them  he is 
      remarkably agreeable     
 
         i do not believe a word of it  my dear  if he had been so very 
      agreeable  he would have talked to mrs  long  but i can guess how 
      it was  everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and i dare 
      say he had heard somehow that mrs  long does not keep a carriage  
      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise     
 
         i do not mind his not talking to mrs  long     said miss lucas  
         but i wish he had danced with eliza     
 
         another time  lizzy     said her mother     i would not dance with 
       him   if i were you     
 
         i believe  ma   am  i may safely promise you  never  to dance with 
      him     
 
         his pride     said miss lucas     does not offend  me  so much as 
      pride often does  because there is an excuse for it  one cannot 
      wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune  
      everything in his favour  should think highly of himself  if i 
      may so express it  he has a  right  to be proud     
 
         that is very true     replied elizabeth     and i could easily 
      forgive  his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine      
 
         pride     observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of 
      her reflections     is a very common failing  i believe  by all 
      that i have ever read  i am convinced that it is very common 
      indeed  that human nature is particularly prone to it  and that 
      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of 
      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other  real or 
      imaginary  vanity and pride are different things  though the 
      words are often used synonymously  a person may be proud without 
      being vain  pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves  
      vanity to what we would have others think of us     
 
         if i were as rich as mr  darcy     cried a young lucas  who came 
      with his sisters     i should not care how proud i was  i would 
      keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine a day     
 
         then you would drink a great deal more than you ought     said 
      mrs  bennet     and if i were to see you at it  i should take away 
      your bottle directly     
 
      the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare 
      that she would  and the argument ended only with the visit  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 6 
 
      the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield  the 
      visit was soon returned in due form  miss bennet   s pleasing 
      manners grew on the goodwill of mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and 
      though the mother was found to be intolerable  and the younger 
      sisters not worth speaking to  a wish of being better acquainted 
      with  them  was expressed towards the two eldest  by jane  this 
      attention was received with the greatest pleasure  but elizabeth 
      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody  
      hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  though 
      their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in 
      all probability from the influence of their brother   s admiration  
      it was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire 
      her and to  her  it was equally evident that jane was yielding to 
      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the 
      first  and was in a way to be very much in love  but she 
      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered 
      by the world in general  since jane united  with great strength 
      of feeling  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of 
      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the 
      impertinent  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas  
 
         it may perhaps be pleasant     replied charlotte     to be able to 
      impose on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a 
      disadvantage to be so very guarded  if a woman conceals her 
      affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose 
      the opportunity of fixing him  and it will then be but poor 
      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark  there is so 
      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it 
      is not safe to leave any to itself  we can all  begin  freely   a 
      slight preference is natural enough  but there are very few of us 
      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement  
      in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show  more  affection 
      than she feels  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he may 
      never do more than like her  if she does not help him on     
 
         but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow  if 
       i  can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton  
      indeed  not to discover it too     
 
         remember  eliza  that he does not know jane   s disposition as you 
      do     
 
         but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to 
      conceal it  he must find it out     
 
         perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  but  though bingley 
      and jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours 
      together  and  as they always see each other in large mixed 
      parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in 
      conversing together  jane should therefore make the most of every 
      half-hour in which she can command his attention  when she is 
      secure of him  there will be more leisure for falling in love as 
      much as she chooses     
 
         your plan is a good one     replied elizabeth     where nothing is 
      in question but the desire of being well married  and if i were 
      determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i 
      should adopt it  but these are not jane   s feelings  she is not 
      acting by design  as yet  she cannot even be certain of the 
      degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness  she has known 
      him only a fortnight  she danced four dances with him at meryton  
      she saw him one morning at his own house  and has since dined 
      with him in company four times  this is not quite enough to make 
      her understand his character     
 
         not as you represent it  had she merely  dined  with him  she 
      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but 
      you must remember that four evenings have also been spent 
      together   and four evenings may do a great deal     
 
         yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that 
      they both like vingt-un better than commerce  but with respect to 
      any other leading characteristic  i do not imagine that much has 
      been unfolded     
 
         well     said charlotte     i wish jane success with all my heart  
      and if she were married to him to-morrow  i should think she had 
      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his 
      character for a twelvemonth  happiness in marriage is entirely a 
      matter of chance  if the dispositions of the parties are ever so 
      well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand  it does 
      not advance their felicity in the least  they always continue to 
      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of 
      vexation  and it is better to know as little as possible of the 
      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life     
 
         you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound  you know it 
      is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself     
 
      occupied in observing mr  bingley   s attentions to her sister  
      elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming 
      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend  mr  darcy 
      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at 
      her without admiration at the ball  and when they next met  he 
      looked at her only to criticise  but no sooner had he made it 
      clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good 
      feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered 
      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark 
      eyes  to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying  
      though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure 
      of perfect symmetry in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her 
      figure to be light and pleasing  and in spite of his asserting 
      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world  he was 
      caught by their easy playfulness  of this she was perfectly 
      unaware  to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable 
      nowhere  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance 
      with  
 
      he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards 
      conversing with her himself  attended to her conversation with 
      others  his doing so drew her notice  it was at sir william 
      lucas   s  where a large party were assembled  
 
         what does mr  darcy mean     said she to charlotte     by listening 
      to my conversation with colonel forster     
 
         that is a question which mr  darcy only can answer     
 
         but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i 
      see what he is about  he has a very satirical eye  and if i do 
      not begin by being impertinent myself  i shall soon grow afraid 
      of him     
 
      on his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming 
      to have any intention of speaking  miss lucas defied her friend 
      to mention such a subject to him  which immediately provoking 
      elizabeth to do it  she turned to him and said  
 
         did you not think  mr  darcy  that i expressed myself uncommonly 
      well just now  when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a 
      ball at meryton     
 
         with great energy  but it is always a subject which makes a lady 
      energetic     
 
         you are severe on us     
 
         it will be  her  turn soon to be teased     said miss lucas     i am 
      going to open the instrument  eliza  and you know what follows     
 
         you are a very strange creature by way of a friend    always 
      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody  if my 
      vanity had taken a musical turn  you would have been invaluable  
      but as it is  i would really rather not sit down before those who 
      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers     on 
      miss lucas   s persevering  however  she added     very well  if it 
      must be so  it must     and gravely glancing at mr  darcy     there 
      is a fine old saying  which everybody here is of course familiar 
      with     keep your breath to cool your porridge     and i shall keep 
      mine to swell my song     
 
      her performance was pleasing  though by no means capital  after a 
      song or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of 
      several that she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at 
      the instrument by her sister mary  who having  in consequence of 
      being the only plain one in the family  worked hard for knowledge 
      and accomplishments  was always impatient for display  
 
      mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given 
      her application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and 
      conceited manner  which would have injured a higher degree of 
      excellence than she had reached  elizabeth  easy and unaffected  
      had been listened to with much more pleasure  though not playing 
      half so well  and mary  at the end of a long concerto  was glad 
      to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs  at the 
      request of her younger sisters  who  with some of the lucases  
      and two or three officers  joined eagerly in dancing at one end 
      of the room  
 
      mr  darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of 
      passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and 
      was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir 
      william lucas was his neighbour  till sir william thus began  
 
         what a charming amusement for young people this is  mr  darcy  
      there is nothing like dancing after all  i consider it as one of 
      the first refinements of polished society     
 
         certainly  sir  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue 
      amongst the less polished societies of the world  every savage 
      can dance     
 
      sir william only smiled     your friend performs delightfully     he 
      continued after a pause  on seeing bingley join the group     and i 
      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself  mr  
      darcy     
 
         you saw me dance at meryton  i believe  sir     
 
         yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the 
      sight  do you often dance at st  james   s     
 
         never  sir     
 
         do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place     
 
         it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid 
      it     
 
         you have a house in town  i conclude     
 
      mr  darcy bowed  
 
         i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself   for i am 
      fond of superior society  but i did not feel quite certain that 
      the air of london would agree with lady lucas     
 
      he paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not 
      disposed to make any  and elizabeth at that instant moving 
      towards them  he was struck with the action of doing a very 
      gallant thing  and called out to her  
 
         my dear miss eliza  why are you not dancing  mr  darcy  you must 
      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable 
      partner  you cannot refuse to dance  i am sure when so much 
      beauty is before you     and  taking her hand  he would have given 
      it to mr  darcy who  though extremely surprised  was not 
      unwilling to receive it  when she instantly drew back  and said 
      with some discomposure to sir william  
 
         indeed  sir  i have not the least intention of dancing  i 
      entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg 
      for a partner     
 
      mr  darcy  with grave propriety  requested to be allowed the 
      honour of her hand  but in vain  elizabeth was determined  nor 
      did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at 
      persuasion  
 
         you excel so much in the dance  miss eliza  that it is cruel to 
      deny me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman 
      dislikes the amusement in general  he can have no objection  i am 
      sure  to oblige us for one half-hour     
 
         mr  darcy is all politeness     said elizabeth  smiling  
 
         he is  indeed  but  considering the inducement  my dear miss 
      eliza  we cannot wonder at his complaisance   for who would object 
      to such a partner     
 
      elizabeth looked archly  and turned away  her resistance had not 
      injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with 
      some complacency  when thus accosted by miss bingley  
 
         i can guess the subject of your reverie     
 
         i should imagine not     
 
         you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many 
      evenings in this manner   in such society  and indeed i am quite of 
      your opinion  i was never more annoyed  the insipidity  and yet 
      the noise   the nothingness  and yet the self-importance of all 
      those people  what would i give to hear your strictures on them     
 
         your conjecture is totally wrong  i assure you  my mind was more 
      agreeably engaged  i have been meditating on the very great 
      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman 
      can bestow     
 
      miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired 
      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such 
      reflections  mr  darcy replied with great intrepidity  
 
         miss elizabeth bennet     
 
         miss elizabeth bennet     repeated miss bingley     i am all 
      astonishment  how long has she been such a favourite    and pray  
      when am i to wish you joy     
 
         that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask  a 
      lady   s imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to 
      love  from love to matrimony  in a moment  i knew you would be 
      wishing me joy     
 
         nay  if you are serious about it  i shall consider the matter is 
      absolutely settled  you will be having a charming mother-in-law  
      indeed  and  of course  she will always be at pemberley with 
      you     
 
      he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to 
      entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced 
      her that all was safe  her wit flowed long  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 7 
 
      mr  bennet   s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of 
      two thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was 
      entailed  in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and 
      their mother   s fortune  though ample for her situation in life  
      could but ill supply the deficiency of his  her father had been 
      an attorney in meryton  and had left her four thousand pounds  
 
      she had a sister married to a mr  phillips  who had been a clerk 
      to their father and succeeded him in the business  and a brother 
      settled in london in a respectable line of trade  
 
      the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  a most 
      convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually 
      tempted thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to 
      their aunt and to a milliner   s shop just over the way  the two 
      youngest of the family  catherine and lydia  were particularly 
      frequent in these attentions  their minds were more vacant than 
      their sisters     and when nothing better offered  a walk to 
      meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish 
      conversation for the evening  and however bare of news the 
      country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some 
      from their aunt  at present  indeed  they were well supplied both 
      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia 
      regiment in the neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter  
      and meryton was the headquarters  
 
      their visits to mrs  phillips were now productive of the most 
      interesting intelligence  every day added something to their 
      knowledge of the officers    names and connections  their lodgings 
      were not long a secret  and at length they began to know the 
      officers themselves  mr  phillips visited them all  and this 
      opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before  they 
      could talk of nothing but officers  and mr  bingley   s large 
      fortune  the mention of which gave animation to their mother  was 
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an 
      ensign  
 
      after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject  
      mr  bennet coolly observed  
 
         from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must 
      be two of the silliest girls in the country  i have suspected it 
      some time  but i am now convinced     
 
      catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but lydia  with 
      perfect indifference  continued to express her admiration of 
      captain carter  and her hope of seeing him in the course of the 
      day  as he was going the next morning to london  
 
         i am astonished  my dear     said mrs  bennet     that you should be 
      so ready to think your own children silly  if i wished to think 
      slightingly of anybody   s children  it should not be of my own  
      however     
 
         if my children are silly  i must hope to be always sensible of 
      it     
 
         yes   but as it happens  they are all of them very clever     
 
         this is the only point  i flatter myself  on which we do not 
      agree  i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every 
      particular  but i must so far differ from you as to think our two 
      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish     
 
         my dear mr  bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the 
      sense of their father and mother  when they get to our age  i 
      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do  
      i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well   and  
      indeed  so i do still at my heart  and if a smart young colonel  
      with five or six thousand a year  should want one of my girls i 
      shall not say nay to him  and i thought colonel forster looked 
      very becoming the other night at sir william   s in his 
      regimentals     
 
         mamma     cried lydia     my aunt says that colonel forster and 
      captain carter do not go so often to miss watson   s as they did 
      when they first came  she sees them now very often standing in 
      clarke   s library     
 
      mrs  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman 
      with a note for miss bennet  it came from netherfield  and the 
      servant waited for an answer  mrs  bennet   s eyes sparkled with 
      pleasure  and she was eagerly calling out  while her daughter 
      read  
 
         well  jane  who is it from  what is it about  what does he say  
      well  jane  make haste and tell us  make haste  my love     
 
         it is from miss bingley     said jane  and then read it aloud  
 
         my dear friend     
         if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa 
      and me  we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest 
      of our lives  for a whole day   s  t  te-  -t  te  between two women 
      can never end without a quarrel  come as soon as you can on 
      receipt of this  my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with 
      the officers    yours ever  
 
         caroline bingley    
 
         with the officers     cried lydia     i wonder my aunt did not tell 
      us of  that      
 
         dining out     said mrs  bennet     that is very unlucky     
 
         can i have the carriage     said jane  
 
         no  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems 
      likely to rain  and then you must stay all night     
 
         that would be a good scheme     said elizabeth     if you were sure 
      that they would not offer to send her home     
 
         oh  but the gentlemen will have mr  bingley   s chaise to go to 
      meryton  and the hursts have no horses to theirs     
 
         i had much rather go in the coach     
 
         but  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  i am sure  
      they are wanted in the farm  mr  bennet  are they not     
 
         they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them     
 
         but if you have got them to-day     said elizabeth     my mother   s 
      purpose will be answered     
 
      she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the 
      horses were engaged  jane was therefore obliged to go on 
      horseback  and her mother attended her to the door with many 
      cheerful prognostics of a bad day  her hopes were answered  jane 
      had not been gone long before it rained hard  her sisters were 
      uneasy for her  but her mother was delighted  the rain continued 
      the whole evening without intermission  jane certainly could not 
      come back  
 
         this was a lucky idea of mine  indeed     said mrs  bennet more 
      than once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own  
      till the next morning  however  she was not aware of all the 
      felicity of her contrivance  breakfast was scarcely over when a 
      servant from netherfield brought the following note for 
      elizabeth  
 
         my dearest lizzy     
         i find myself very unwell this morning  which  i suppose  is to 
      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday  my kind friends 
      will not hear of my returning till i am better  they insist also 
      on my seeing mr  jones   therefore do not be alarmed if you should 
      hear of his having been to me   and  excepting a sore throat and 
      headache  there is not much the matter with me    yours  etc     
 
         well  my dear     said mr  bennet  when elizabeth had read the 
      note aloud     if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of 
      illness   if she should die  it would be a comfort to know that it 
      was all in pursuit of mr  bingley  and under your orders     
 
         oh  i am not afraid of her dying  people do not die of little 
      trifling colds  she will be taken good care of  as long as she 
      stays there  it is all very well  i would go and see her if i 
      could have the carriage     
 
      elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her  
      though the carriage was not to be had  and as she was no 
      horsewoman  walking was her only alternative  she declared her 
      resolution  
 
         how can you be so silly     cried her mother     as to think of such 
      a thing  in all this dirt  you will not be fit to be seen when 
      you get there     
 
         i shall be very fit to see jane   which is all i want     
 
         is this a hint to me  lizzy     said her father     to send for the 
      horses     
 
         no  indeed  i do not wish to avoid the walk  the distance is 
      nothing when one has a motive  only three miles  i shall be back 
      by dinner     
 
         i admire the activity of your benevolence     observed mary     but 
      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my 
      opinion  exertion should always be in proportion to what is 
      required     
 
         we will go as far as meryton with you     said catherine and 
      lydia  elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young 
      ladies set off together  
 
         if we make haste     said lydia  as they walked along     perhaps we 
      may see something of captain carter before he goes     
 
      in meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings 
      of one of the officers    wives  and elizabeth continued her walk 
      alone  crossing field after field at a quick pace  jumping over 
      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity  and 
      finding herself at last within view of the house  with weary 
      ankles  dirty stockings  and a face glowing with the warmth of 
      exercise  
 
      she was shown into the breakfast-parlour  where all but jane were 
      assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of 
      surprise  that she should have walked three miles so early in the 
      day  in such dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible 
      to mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and elizabeth was convinced that 
      they held her in contempt for it  she was received  however  very 
      politely by them  and in their brother   s manners there was 
      something better than politeness  there was good humour and 
      kindness  mr  darcy said very little  and mr  hurst nothing at 
      all  the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy 
      which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as to the 
      occasion   s justifying her coming so far alone  the latter was 
      thinking only of his breakfast  
 
      her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered  
      miss bennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish  and 
      not well enough to leave her room  elizabeth was glad to be taken 
      to her immediately  and jane  who had only been withheld by the 
      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note 
      how much she longed for such a visit  was delighted at her 
      entrance  she was not equal  however  to much conversation  and 
      when miss bingley left them together  could attempt little 
      besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness 
      she was treated with  elizabeth silently attended her  
 
      when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters  and 
      elizabeth began to like them herself  when she saw how much 
      affection and solicitude they showed for jane  the apothecary 
      came  and having examined his patient  said  as might be 
      supposed  that she had caught a violent cold  and that they must 
      endeavour to get the better of it  advised her to return to bed  
      and promised her some draughts  the advice was followed readily  
      for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head ached acutely  
      elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were the other 
      ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had  in fact  
      nothing to do elsewhere  
 
      when the clock struck three  elizabeth felt that she must go  and 
      very unwillingly said so  miss bingley offered her the carriage  
      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it  when jane 
      testified such concern in parting with her  that miss bingley was 
      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to 
      remain at netherfield for the present  elizabeth most thankfully 
      consented  and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint 
      the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 8 
 
      at five o   clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half-past 
      six elizabeth was summoned to dinner  to the civil enquiries 
      which then poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of 
      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr  bingley   s  she 
      could not make a very favourable answer  jane was by no means 
      better  the sisters  on hearing this  repeated three or four 
      times how much they were grieved  how shocking it was to have a 
      bad cold  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves  
      and then thought no more of the matter  and their indifference 
      towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth 
      to the enjoyment of all her former dislike  
 
      their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she 
      could regard with any complacency  his anxiety for jane was 
      evident  and his attentions to herself most pleasing  and they 
      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed 
      she was considered by the others  she had very little notice from 
      any but him  miss bingley was engrossed by mr  darcy  her sister 
      scarcely less so  and as for mr  hurst  by whom elizabeth sat  he 
      was an indolent man  who lived only to eat  drink  and play at 
      cards  who  when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout  
      had nothing to say to her  
 
      when dinner was over  she returned directly to jane  and miss 
      bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  her 
      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride 
      and impertinence  she had no conversation  no style  no beauty  
      mrs  hurst thought the same  and added  
 
         she has nothing  in short  to recommend her  but being an 
      excellent walker  i shall never forget her appearance this 
      morning  she really looked almost wild     
 
         she did  indeed  louisa  i could hardly keep my countenance  
      very nonsensical to come at all  why must  she  be scampering 
      about the country  because her sister had a cold  her hair  so 
      untidy  so blowsy     
 
         yes  and her petticoat  i hope you saw her petticoat  six inches 
      deep in mud  i am absolutely certain  and the gown which had been 
      let down to hide it not doing its office     
 
         your picture may be very exact  louisa     said bingley     but this 
      was all lost upon me  i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked 
      remarkably well when she came into the room this morning  her 
      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice     
 
          you  observed it  mr  darcy  i am sure     said miss bingley  
         and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your 
      sister  make such an exhibition     
 
         certainly not     
 
         to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever 
      it is  above her ankles in dirt  and alone  quite alone  what 
      could she mean by it  it seems to me to show an abominable sort 
      of conceited independence  a most country-town indifference to 
      decorum     
 
         it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing     
      said bingley  
 
         i am afraid  mr  darcy     observed miss bingley in a half 
      whisper     that this adventure has rather affected your admiration 
      of her fine eyes     
 
         not at all     he replied     they were brightened by the exercise     
      a short pause followed this speech  and mrs  hurst began again  
 
         i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet  she is really a 
      very sweet girl  and i wish with all my heart she were well 
      settled  but with such a father and mother  and such low 
      connections  i am afraid there is no chance of it     
 
         i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in 
      meryton     
 
         yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside     
 
         that is capital     added her sister  and they both laughed 
      heartily  
 
         if they had uncles enough to fill  all  cheapside     cried 
      bingley     it would not make them one jot less agreeable     
 
         but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men 
      of any consideration in the world     replied darcy  
 
      to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it 
      their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at 
      the expense of their dear friend   s vulgar relations  
 
      with a renewal of tenderness  however  they returned to her room 
      on leaving the dining-parlour  and sat with her till summoned to 
      coffee  she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit 
      her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of 
      seeing her sleep  and when it seemed to her rather right than 
      pleasant that she should go downstairs herself  on entering the 
      drawing-room she found the whole party at loo  and was 
      immediately invited to join them  but suspecting them to be 
      playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse  
      said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay 
      below  with a book  mr  hurst looked at her with astonishment  
 
         do you prefer reading to cards     said he     that is rather 
      singular     
 
         miss eliza bennet     said miss bingley     despises cards  she is a 
      great reader  and has no pleasure in anything else     
 
         i deserve neither such praise nor such censure     cried 
      elizabeth     i am  not  a great reader  and i have pleasure in 
      many things     
 
         in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure     said 
      bingley     and i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her 
      quite well     
 
      elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards the 
      table where a few books were lying  he immediately offered to 
      fetch her others   all that his library afforded  
 
         and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own 
      credit  but i am an idle fellow  and though i have not many  i 
      have more than i ever looked into     
 
      elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with 
      those in the room  
 
         i am astonished     said miss bingley     that my father should have 
      left so small a collection of books  what a delightful library 
      you have at pemberley  mr  darcy     
 
         it ought to be good     he replied     it has been the work of many 
      generations     
 
         and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always 
      buying books     
 
         i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days 
      as these     
 
         neglect  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the 
      beauties of that noble place  charles  when you build  your  
      house  i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley     
 
         i wish it may     
 
         but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that 
      neighbourhood  and take pemberley for a kind of model  there is 
      not a finer county in england than derbyshire     
 
         with all my heart  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will 
      sell it     
 
         i am talking of possibilities  charles     
 
         upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get 
      pemberley by purchase than by imitation     
 
      elizabeth was so much caught with what passed  as to leave her 
      very little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly 
      aside  she drew near the card-table  and stationed herself 
      between mr  bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game  
 
         is miss darcy much grown since the spring     said miss bingley  
         will she be as tall as i am     
 
         i think she will  she is now about miss elizabeth bennet   s 
      height  or rather taller     
 
         how i long to see her again  i never met with anybody who 
      delighted me so much  such a countenance  such manners  and so 
      extremely accomplished for her age  her performance on the 
      pianoforte is exquisite     
 
         it is amazing to me     said bingley     how young ladies can have 
      patience to be so very accomplished as they all are     
 
         all young ladies accomplished  my dear charles  what do you 
      mean     
 
         yes  all of them  i think  they all paint tables  cover screens  
      and net purses  i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this  
      and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first 
      time  without being informed that she was very accomplished     
 
         your list of the common extent of accomplishments     said darcy  
         has too much truth  the word is applied to many a woman who 
      deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a 
      screen  but i am very far from agreeing with you in your 
      estimation of ladies in general  i cannot boast of knowing more 
      than half-a-dozen  in the whole range of my acquaintance  that 
      are really accomplished     
 
         nor i  i am sure     said miss bingley  
 
         then     observed elizabeth     you must comprehend a great deal in 
      your idea of an accomplished woman     
 
         yes  i do comprehend a great deal in it     
 
         oh  certainly     cried his faithful assistant     no one can be 
      really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is 
      usually met with  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of 
      music  singing  drawing  dancing  and the modern languages  to 
      deserve the word  and besides all this  she must possess a 
      certain something in her air and manner of walking  the tone of 
      her voice  her address and expressions  or the word will be but 
      half-deserved     
 
         all this she must possess     added darcy     and to all this she 
      must yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of 
      her mind by extensive reading     
 
         i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished 
      women  i rather wonder now at your knowing  any      
 
         are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility 
      of all this     
 
          i  never saw such a woman   i  never saw such capacity  and 
      taste  and application  and elegance  as you describe united     
 
      mrs  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice 
      of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew 
      many women who answered this description  when mr  hurst called 
      them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to 
      what was going forward  as all conversation was thereby at an 
      end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the room  
 
         elizabeth bennet     said miss bingley  when the door was closed 
      on her     is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend 
      themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own  and with 
      many men  i dare say  it succeeds  but  in my opinion  it is a 
      paltry device  a very mean art     
 
         undoubtedly     replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly 
      addressed     there is a meanness in  all  the arts which ladies 
      sometimes condescend to employ for captivation  whatever bears 
      affinity to cunning is despicable     
 
      miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to 
      continue the subject  
 
      elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was 
      worse  and that she could not leave her  bingley urged mr  jones 
      being sent for immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no 
      country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to 
      town for one of the most eminent physicians  this she would not 
      hear of  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their 
      brother   s proposal  and it was settled that mr  jones should be 
      sent for early in the morning  if miss bennet were not decidedly 
      better  bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters declared 
      that they were miserable  they solaced their wretchedness  
      however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better 
      relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions 
      that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her 
      sister  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 9 
 
      elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister   s room  and 
      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable 
      answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr  
      bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two 
      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters  in spite of this 
      amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to 
      longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her own 
      judgement of her situation  the note was immediately dispatched  
      and its contents as quickly complied with  mrs  bennet  
      accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon 
      after the family breakfast  
 
      had she found jane in any apparent danger  mrs  bennet would have 
      been very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her 
      illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering 
      immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove 
      her from netherfield  she would not listen  therefore  to her 
      daughter   s proposal of being carried home  neither did the 
      apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all 
      advisable  after sitting a little while with jane  on miss 
      bingley   s appearance and invitation  the mother and three 
      daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour  bingley 
      met them with hopes that mrs  bennet had not found miss bennet 
      worse than she expected  
 
         indeed i have  sir     was her answer     she is a great deal too 
      ill to be moved  mr  jones says we must not think of moving her  
      we must trespass a little longer on your kindness     
 
         removed     cried bingley     it must not be thought of  my sister  
      i am sure  will not hear of her removal     
 
         you may depend upon it  madam     said miss bingley  with cold 
      civility     that miss bennet will receive every possible attention 
      while she remains with us     
 
      mrs  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments  
 
         i am sure     she added     if it was not for such good friends i do 
      not know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed  
      and suffers a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the 
      world  which is always the way with her  for she has  without 
      exception  the sweetest temper i have ever met with  i often tell 
      my other girls they are nothing to  her   you have a sweet room 
      here  mr  bingley  and a charming prospect over the gravel walk  
      i do not know a place in the country that is equal to 
      netherfield  you will not think of quitting it in a hurry  i 
      hope  though you have but a short lease     
 
         whatever i do is done in a hurry     replied he     and therefore if 
      i should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in 
      five minutes  at present  however  i consider myself as quite 
      fixed here     
 
         that is exactly what i should have supposed of you     said 
      elizabeth  
 
         you begin to comprehend me  do you     cried he  turning towards 
      her  
 
         oh  yes   i understand you perfectly     
 
         i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily 
      seen through i am afraid is pitiful     
 
         that is as it happens  it does not follow that a deep  intricate 
      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours     
 
         lizzy     cried her mother     remember where you are  and do not 
      run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home     
 
         i did not know before     continued bingley immediately     that you 
      were a studier of character  it must be an amusing study     
 
         yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing  they have 
      at least that advantage     
 
         the country     said darcy     can in general supply but a few 
      subjects for such a study  in a country neighbourhood you move in 
      a very confined and unvarying society     
 
         but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new 
      to be observed in them for ever     
 
         yes  indeed     cried mrs  bennet  offended by his manner of 
      mentioning a country neighbourhood     i assure you there is quite 
      as much of  that  going on in the country as in town     
 
      everybody was surprised  and darcy  after looking at her for a 
      moment  turned silently away  mrs  bennet  who fancied she had 
      gained a complete victory over him  continued her triumph  
 
         i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the 
      country  for my part  except the shops and public places  the 
      country is a vast deal pleasanter  is it not  mr  bingley     
 
         when i am in the country     he replied     i never wish to leave 
      it  and when i am in town it is pretty much the same  they have 
      each their advantages  and i can be equally happy in either     
 
         aye   that is because you have the right disposition  but that 
      gentleman     looking at darcy     seemed to think the country was 
      nothing at all     
 
         indeed  mamma  you are mistaken     said elizabeth  blushing for 
      her mother     you quite mistook mr  darcy  he only meant that 
      there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the 
      country as in the town  which you must acknowledge to be true     
 
         certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not 
      meeting with many people in this neighbourhood  i believe there 
      are few neighbourhoods larger  i know we dine with 
      four-and-twenty families     
 
      nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep 
      his countenance  his sister was less delicate  and directed her 
      eyes towards mr  darcy with a very expressive smile  elizabeth  
      for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother   s 
      thoughts  now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn 
      since  her  coming away  
 
         yes  she called yesterday with her father  what an agreeable man 
      sir william is  mr  bingley  is not he  so much the man of 
      fashion  so genteel and easy  he has always something to say to 
      everybody   that  is my idea of good breeding  and those persons 
      who fancy themselves very important  and never open their mouths  
      quite mistake the matter     
 
         did charlotte dine with you     
 
         no  she would go home  i fancy she was wanted about the 
      mince-pies  for my part  mr  bingley   i  always keep servants 
      that can do their own work   my  daughters are brought up very 
      differently  but everybody is to judge for themselves  and the 
      lucases are a very good sort of girls  i assure you  it is a pity 
      they are not handsome  not that  i  think charlotte so  very  
      plain   but then she is our particular friend     
 
         she seems a very pleasant young woman     
 
         oh  dear  yes  but you must own she is very plain  lady lucas 
      herself has often said so  and envied me jane   s beauty  i do not 
      like to boast of my own child  but to be sure  jane   one does not 
      often see anybody better looking  it is what everybody says  i do 
      not trust my own partiality  when she was only fifteen  there was 
      a man at my brother gardiner   s in town so much in love with her 
      that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before 
      we came away  but  however  he did not  perhaps he thought her 
      too young  however  he wrote some verses on her  and very pretty 
      they were     
 
         and so ended his affection     said elizabeth impatiently     there 
      has been many a one  i fancy  overcome in the same way  i wonder 
      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away 
      love     
 
         i have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love     said 
      darcy  
 
         of a fine  stout  healthy love it may  everything nourishes what 
      is strong already  but if it be only a slight  thin sort of 
      inclination  i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it 
      entirely away     
 
      darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made 
      elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself 
      again  she longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say  
      and after a short silence mrs  bennet began repeating her thanks 
      to mr  bingley for his kindness to jane  with an apology for 
      troubling him also with lizzy  mr  bingley was unaffectedly civil 
      in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be civil also  
      and say what the occasion required  she performed her part indeed 
      without much graciousness  but mrs  bennet was satisfied  and 
      soon afterwards ordered her carriage  upon this signal  the 
      youngest of her daughters put herself forward  the two girls had 
      been whispering to each other during the whole visit  and the 
      result of it was  that the youngest should tax mr  bingley with 
      having promised on his first coming into the country to give a 
      ball at netherfield  
 
      lydia was a stout  well-grown girl of fifteen  with a fine 
      complexion and good-humoured countenance  a favourite with her 
      mother  whose affection had brought her into public at an early 
      age  she had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural 
      self-consequence  which the attention of the officers  to whom 
      her uncle   s good dinners  and her own easy manners recommended 
      her  had increased into assurance  she was very equal  therefore  
      to address mr  bingley on the subject of the ball  and abruptly 
      reminded him of his promise  adding  that it would be the most 
      shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  his answer to 
      this sudden attack was delightful to their mother   s ear  
 
         i am perfectly ready  i assure you  to keep my engagement  and 
      when your sister is recovered  you shall  if you please  name the 
      very day of the ball  but you would not wish to be dancing when 
      she is ill     
 
      lydia declared herself satisfied     oh  yes   it would be much 
      better to wait till jane was well  and by that time most likely 
      captain carter would be at meryton again  and when you have given 
       your  ball     she added     i shall insist on their giving one 
      also  i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he 
      does not     
 
      mrs  bennet and her daughters then departed  and elizabeth 
      returned instantly to jane  leaving her own and her relations    
      behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr  darcy  the 
      latter of whom  however  could not be prevailed on to join in 
      their censure of  her   in spite of all miss bingley   s witticisms 
      on  fine eyes   
 
 
 
 
      chapter 10 
 
      the day passed much as the day before had done  mrs  hurst and 
      miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the 
      invalid  who continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the 
      evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room  the 
      loo-table  however  did not appear  mr  darcy was writing  and 
      miss bingley  seated near him  was watching the progress of his 
      letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to 
      his sister  mr  hurst and mr  bingley were at piquet  and mrs  
      hurst was observing their game  
 
      elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in 
      attending to what passed between darcy and his companion  the 
      perpetual commendations of the lady  either on his handwriting  
      or on the evenness of his lines  or on the length of his letter  
      with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received  
      formed a curious dialogue  and was exactly in union with her 
      opinion of each  
 
         how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter     
 
      he made no answer  
 
         you write uncommonly fast     
 
         you are mistaken  i write rather slowly     
 
         how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course 
      of a year  letters of business  too  how odious i should think 
      them     
 
         it is fortunate  then  that they fall to my lot instead of 
      yours     
 
         pray tell your sister that i long to see her     
 
         i have already told her so once  by your desire     
 
         i am afraid you do not like your pen  let me mend it for you  i 
      mend pens remarkably well     
 
         thank you   but i always mend my own     
 
         how can you contrive to write so even     
 
      he was silent  
 
         tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on 
      the harp  and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with 
      her beautiful little design for a table  and i think it 
      infinitely superior to miss grantley   s     
 
         will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write 
      again  at present i have not room to do them justice     
 
         oh  it is of no consequence  i shall see her in january  but do 
      you always write such charming long letters to her  mr  darcy     
 
         they are generally long  but whether always charming it is not 
      for me to determine     
 
         it is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter 
      with ease  cannot write ill     
 
         that will not do for a compliment to darcy  caroline     cried her 
      brother     because he does  not  write with ease  he studies too 
      much for words of four syllables  do not you  darcy     
 
         my style of writing is very different from yours     
 
         oh     cried miss bingley     charles writes in the most careless 
      way imaginable  he leaves out half his words  and blots the 
      rest     
 
         my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them   by 
      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my 
      correspondents     
 
         your humility  mr  bingley     said elizabeth     must disarm 
      reproof     
 
         nothing is more deceitful     said darcy     than the appearance of 
      humility  it is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes 
      an indirect boast     
 
         and which of the two do you call  my  little recent piece of 
      modesty     
 
         the indirect boast  for you are really proud of your defects in 
      writing  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity 
      of thought and carelessness of execution  which  if not 
      estimable  you think at least highly interesting  the power of 
      doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the 
      possessor  and often without any attention to the imperfection of 
      the performance  when you told mrs  bennet this morning that if 
      you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield you should be gone in 
      five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric  of 
      compliment to yourself   and yet what is there so very laudable in 
      a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone  
      and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else     
 
         nay     cried bingley     this is too much  to remember at night all 
      the foolish things that were said in the morning  and yet  upon 
      my honour  i believe what i said of myself to be true  and i 
      believe it at this moment  at least  therefore  i did not assume 
      the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before 
      the ladies     
 
         i dare say you believed it  but i am by no means convinced that 
      you would be gone with such celerity  your conduct would be quite 
      as dependent on chance as that of any man i know  and if  as you 
      were mounting your horse  a friend were to say     bingley  you had 
      better stay till next week     you would probably do it  you would 
      probably not go   and at another word  might stay a month     
 
         you have only proved by this     cried elizabeth     that mr  
      bingley did not do justice to his own disposition  you have shown 
      him off now much more than he did himself     
 
         i am exceedingly gratified     said bingley     by your converting 
      what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my 
      temper  but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that 
      gentleman did by no means intend  for he would certainly think 
      better of me  if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat 
      denial  and ride off as fast as i could     
 
         would mr  darcy then consider the rashness of your original 
      intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it     
 
         upon my word  i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must 
      speak for himself     
 
         you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call 
      mine  but which i have never acknowledged  allowing the case  
      however  to stand according to your representation  you must 
      remember  miss bennet  that the friend who is supposed to desire 
      his return to the house  and the delay of his plan  has merely 
      desired it  asked it without offering one argument in favour of 
      its propriety     
 
         to yield readily   easily   to the  persuasion  of a friend is no 
      merit with you     
 
         to yield without conviction is no compliment to the 
      understanding of either     
 
         you appear to me  mr  darcy  to allow nothing for the influence 
      of friendship and affection  a regard for the requester would 
      often make one readily yield to a request  without waiting for 
      arguments to reason one into it  i am not particularly speaking 
      of such a case as you have supposed about mr  bingley  we may as 
      well wait  perhaps  till the circumstance occurs before we 
      discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon  but in general 
      and ordinary cases between friend and friend  where one of them 
      is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great 
      moment  should you think ill of that person for complying with 
      the desire  without waiting to be argued into it     
 
         will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to 
      arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which 
      is to appertain to this request  as well as the degree of 
      intimacy subsisting between the parties     
 
         by all means     cried bingley     let us hear all the particulars  
      not forgetting their comparative height and size  for that will 
      have more weight in the argument  miss bennet  than you may be 
      aware of  i assure you  that if darcy were not such a great tall 
      fellow  in comparison with myself  i should not pay him half so 
      much deference  i declare i do not know a more awful object than 
      darcy  on particular occasions  and in particular places  at his 
      own house especially  and of a sunday evening  when he has 
      nothing to do     
 
      mr  darcy smiled  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that 
      he was rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh  miss 
      bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received  in an 
      expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense  
 
         i see your design  bingley     said his friend     you dislike an 
      argument  and want to silence this     
 
         perhaps i do  arguments are too much like disputes  if you and 
      miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room  i shall 
      be very thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me     
 
         what you ask     said elizabeth     is no sacrifice on my side  and 
      mr  darcy had much better finish his letter     
 
      mr  darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter  
 
      when that business was over  he applied to miss bingley and 
      elizabeth for an indulgence of some music  miss bingley moved 
      with some alacrity to the pianoforte  and  after a polite request 
      that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and 
      more earnestly negatived  she seated herself  
 
      mrs  hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus 
      employed  elizabeth could not help observing  as she turned over 
      some music-books that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr  
      darcy   s eyes were fixed on her  she hardly knew how to suppose 
      that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  and 
      yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still 
      more strange  she could only imagine  however  at last that she 
      drew his notice because there was something more wrong and 
      reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in any other 
      person present  the supposition did not pain her  she liked him 
      too little to care for his approbation  
 
      after playing some italian songs  miss bingley varied the charm 
      by a lively scotch air  and soon afterwards mr  darcy  drawing 
      near elizabeth  said to her  
 
         do not you feel a great inclination  miss bennet  to seize such 
      an opportunity of dancing a reel     
 
      she smiled  but made no answer  he repeated the question  with 
      some surprise at her silence  
 
         oh     said she     i heard you before  but i could not immediately 
      determine what to say in reply  you wanted me  i know  to say 
         yes     that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste  
      but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and 
      cheating a person of their premeditated contempt  i have  
      therefore  made up my mind to tell you  that i do not want to 
      dance a reel at all   and now despise me if you dare     
 
         indeed i do not dare     
 
      elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at 
      his gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness 
      in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody  
      and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by 
      her  he really believed  that were it not for the inferiority of 
      her connections  he should be in some danger  
 
      miss bingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her 
      great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received 
      some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth  
 
      she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest  by 
      talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in 
      such an alliance  
 
         i hope     said she  as they were walking together in the 
      shrubbery the next day     you will give your mother-in-law a few 
      hints  when this desirable event takes place  as to the advantage 
      of holding her tongue  and if you can compass it  do cure the 
      younger girls of running after officers  and  if i may mention so 
      delicate a subject  endeavour to check that little something  
      bordering on conceit and impertinence  which your lady 
      possesses     
 
         have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity     
 
         oh  yes  do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be 
      placed in the gallery at pemberley  put them next to your 
      great-uncle the judge  they are in the same profession  you know  
      only in different lines  as for your elizabeth   s picture  you 
      must not have it taken  for what painter could do justice to 
      those beautiful eyes     
 
         it would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but 
      their colour and shape  and the eyelashes  so remarkably fine  
      might be copied     
 
      at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs  hurst and 
      elizabeth herself  
 
         i did not know that you intended to walk     said miss bingley  in 
      some confusion  lest they had been overheard  
 
         you used us abominably ill     answered mrs  hurst     running away 
      without telling us that you were coming out     
 
      then taking the disengaged arm of mr  darcy  she left elizabeth 
      to walk by herself  the path just admitted three  mr  darcy felt 
      their rudeness  and immediately said  
 
         this walk is not wide enough for our party  we had better go 
      into the avenue     
 
      but elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with 
      them  laughingly answered  
 
         no  no  stay where you are  you are charmingly grouped  and 
      appear to uncommon advantage  the picturesque would be spoilt by 
      admitting a fourth  good-bye     
 
      she then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the 
      hope of being at home again in a day or two  jane was already so 
      much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of 
      hours that evening  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 11 
 
      when the ladies removed after dinner  elizabeth ran up to her 
      sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into 
      the drawing-room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with 
      many professions of pleasure  and elizabeth had never seen them 
      so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the 
      gentlemen appeared  their powers of conversation were 
      considerable  they could describe an entertainment with accuracy  
      relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh at their acquaintance 
      with spirit  
 
      but when the gentlemen entered  jane was no longer the first 
      object  miss bingley   s eyes were instantly turned toward darcy  
      and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many 
      steps  he addressed himself to miss bennet  with a polite 
      congratulation  mr  hurst also made her a slight bow  and said he 
      was    very glad     but diffuseness and warmth remained for 
      bingley   s salutation  he was full of joy and attention  the first 
      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she should suffer 
      from the change of room  and she removed at his desire to the 
      other side of the fireplace  that she might be further from the 
      door  he then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to anyone 
      else  elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with 
      great delight  
 
      when tea was over  mr  hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the 
      card-table   but in vain  she had obtained private intelligence 
      that mr  darcy did not wish for cards  and mr  hurst soon found 
      even his open petition rejected  she assured him that no one 
      intended to play  and the silence of the whole party on the 
      subject seemed to justify her  mr  hurst had therefore nothing to 
      do  but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep  
      darcy took up a book  miss bingley did the same  and mrs  hurst  
      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings  
      joined now and then in her brother   s conversation with miss 
      bennet  
 
      miss bingley   s attention was quite as much engaged in watching 
      mr  darcy   s progress through  his  book  as in reading her own  
      and she was perpetually either making some enquiry  or looking at 
      his page  she could not win him  however  to any conversation  he 
      merely answered her question  and read on  at length  quite 
      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book  which 
      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his  she 
      gave a great yawn and said     how pleasant it is to spend an 
      evening in this way  i declare after all there is no enjoyment 
      like reading  how much sooner one tires of anything than of a 
      book  when i have a house of my own  i shall be miserable if i 
      have not an excellent library     
 
      no one made any reply  she then yawned again  threw aside her 
      book  and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some 
      amusement  when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss 
      bennet  she turned suddenly towards him and said  
 
         by the bye  charles  are you really serious in meditating a 
      dance at netherfield  i would advise you  before you determine on 
      it  to consult the wishes of the present party  i am much 
      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be 
      rather a punishment than a pleasure     
 
         if you mean darcy     cried her brother     he may go to bed  if he 
      chooses  before it begins   but as for the ball  it is quite a 
      settled thing  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup 
      enough  i shall send round my cards     
 
         i should like balls infinitely better     she replied     if they 
      were carried on in a different manner  but there is something 
      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting  it 
      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of 
      dancing were made the order of the day     
 
         much more rational  my dear caroline  i dare say  but it would 
      not be near so much like a ball     
 
      miss bingley made no answer  and soon afterwards she got up and 
      walked about the room  her figure was elegant  and she walked 
      well  but darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly 
      studious  in the desperation of her feelings  she resolved on one 
      effort more  and  turning to elizabeth  said  
 
         miss eliza bennet  let me persuade you to follow my example  and 
      take a turn about the room  i assure you it is very refreshing 
      after sitting so long in one attitude     
 
      elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately  miss 
      bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  mr  
      darcy looked up  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention 
      in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously 
      closed his book  he was directly invited to join their party  but 
      he declined it  observing that he could imagine but two motives 
      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together  with 
      either of which motives his joining them would interfere     what 
      could he mean  she was dying to know what could be his 
      meaning       and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand 
      him  
 
         not at all     was her answer     but depend upon it  he means to be 
      severe on us  and our surest way of disappointing him will be to 
      ask nothing about it     
 
      miss bingley  however  was incapable of disappointing mr  darcy 
      in anything  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation 
      of his two motives  
 
         i have not the smallest objection to explaining them     said he  
      as soon as she allowed him to speak     you either choose this 
      method of passing the evening because you are in each other   s 
      confidence  and have secret affairs to discuss  or because you 
      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage 
      in walking  if the first  i would be completely in your way  and 
      if the second  i can admire you much better as i sit by the 
      fire     
 
         oh  shocking     cried miss bingley     i never heard anything so 
      abominable  how shall we punish him for such a speech     
 
         nothing so easy  if you have but the inclination     said 
      elizabeth     we can all plague and punish one another  tease 
      him   laugh at him  intimate as you are  you must know how it is to 
      be done     
 
         but upon my honour  i do  not   i do assure you that my intimacy 
      has not yet taught me  that   tease calmness of manner and 
      presence of mind  no  no  i feel he may defy us there  and as to 
      laughter  we will not expose ourselves  if you please  by 
      attempting to laugh without a subject  mr  darcy may hug 
      himself     
 
         mr  darcy is not to be laughed at     cried elizabeth     that is an 
      uncommon advantage  and uncommon i hope it will continue  for it 
      would be a great loss to  me  to have many such acquaintances  i 
      dearly love a laugh     
 
         miss bingley     said he     has given me more credit than can be  
      the wisest and the best of men   nay  the wisest and best of their 
      actions   may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object 
      in life is a joke     
 
         certainly     replied elizabeth      there are such people  but i hope 
      i am not one of  them   i hope i never ridicule what is wise and 
      good  follies and nonsense  whims and inconsistencies   do  
      divert me  i own  and i laugh at them whenever i can  but these  
      i suppose  are precisely what you are without     
 
         perhaps that is not possible for anyone  but it has been the 
      study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a 
      strong understanding to ridicule     
 
         such as vanity and pride     
 
         yes  vanity is a weakness indeed  but pride   where there is a 
      real superiority of mind  pride will be always under good 
      regulation     
 
      elizabeth turned away to hide a smile  
 
         your examination of mr  darcy is over  i presume     said miss 
      bingley     and pray what is the result     
 
         i am perfectly convinced by it that mr  darcy has no defect  he 
      owns it himself without disguise     
 
         no     said darcy     i have made no such pretension  i have faults 
      enough  but they are not  i hope  of understanding  my temper i 
      dare not vouch for  it is  i believe  too little 
      yielding   certainly too little for the convenience of the world  i 
      cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought  
      nor their offenses against myself  my feelings are not puffed 
      about with every attempt to move them  my temper would perhaps be 
      called resentful  my good opinion once lost  is lost forever     
 
          that  is a failing indeed     cried elizabeth     implacable 
      resentment  is  a shade in a character  but you have chosen your 
      fault well  i really cannot  laugh  at it  you are safe from me     
 
         there is  i believe  in every disposition a tendency to some 
      particular evil   a natural defect  which not even the best 
      education can overcome     
 
         and  your  defect is to hate everybody     
 
         and yours     he replied with a smile     is willfully to 
      misunderstand them     
 
         do let us have a little music     cried miss bingley  tired of a 
      conversation in which she had no share     louisa  you will not 
      mind my waking mr  hurst     
 
      her sister had not the smallest objection  and the pianoforte was 
      opened  and darcy  after a few moments    recollection  was not 
      sorry for it  he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too 
      much attention  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 12 
 
      in consequence of an agreement between the sisters  elizabeth 
      wrote the next morning to their mother  to beg that the carriage 
      might be sent for them in the course of the day  but mrs  bennet  
      who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till 
      the following tuesday  which would exactly finish jane   s week  
      could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before  her 
      answer  therefore  was not propitious  at least not to 
      elizabeth   s wishes  for she was impatient to get home  mrs  
      bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the 
      carriage before tuesday  and in her postscript it was added  that 
      if mr  bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she 
      could spare them very well  against staying longer  however  
      elizabeth was positively resolved   nor did she much expect it 
      would be asked  and fearful  on the contrary  as being considered 
      as intruding themselves needlessly long  she urged jane to borrow 
      mr  bingley   s carriage immediately  and at length it was settled 
      that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning 
      should be mentioned  and the request made  
 
      the communication excited many professions of concern  and enough 
      was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day 
      to work on jane  and till the morrow their going was deferred  
      miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for 
      her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her 
      affection for the other  
 
      the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to 
      go so soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it 
      would not be safe for her   that she was not enough recovered  but 
      jane was firm where she felt herself to be right  
 
      to mr  darcy it was welcome intelligence   elizabeth had been at 
      netherfield long enough  she attracted him more than he liked   and 
      miss bingley was uncivil to  her   and more teasing than usual to 
      himself  he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no 
      sign of admiration should  now  escape him  nothing that could 
      elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity  sensible 
      that if such an idea had been suggested  his behaviour during the 
      last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it  
      steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke ten words to her through 
      the whole of saturday  and though they were at one time left by 
      themselves for half-an-hour  he adhered most conscientiously to 
      his book  and would not even look at her  
 
      on sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to 
      almost all  took place  miss bingley   s civility to elizabeth 
      increased at last very rapidly  as well as her affection for 
      jane  and when they parted  after assuring the latter of the 
      pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn 
      or netherfield  and embracing her most tenderly  she even shook 
      hands with the former  elizabeth took leave of the whole party in 
      the liveliest of spirits  
 
      they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  mrs  
      bennet wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to 
      give so much trouble  and was sure jane would have caught cold 
      again  but their father  though very laconic in his expressions 
      of pleasure  was really glad to see them  he had felt their 
      importance in the family circle  the evening conversation  when 
      they were all assembled  had lost much of its animation  and 
      almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth  
 
      they found mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough-bass and 
      human nature  and had some extracts to admire  and some new 
      observations of threadbare morality to listen to  catherine and 
      lydia had information for them of a different sort  much had been 
      done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding 
      wednesday  several of the officers had dined lately with their 
      uncle  a private had been flogged  and it had actually been 
      hinted that colonel forster was going to be married  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 13 
 
         i hope  my dear     said mr  bennet to his wife  as they were at 
      breakfast the next morning     that you have ordered a good dinner 
      to-day  because i have reason to expect an addition to our family 
      party     
 
         who do you mean  my dear  i know of nobody that is coming  i am 
      sure  unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in   and i hope 
       my  dinners are good enough for her  i do not believe she often 
      sees such at home     
 
         the person of whom i speak is a gentleman  and a stranger     
 
      mrs  bennet   s eyes sparkled     a gentleman and a stranger  it is 
      mr  bingley  i am sure  well  i am sure i shall be extremely glad 
      to see mr  bingley  but   good lord  how unlucky  there is not a 
      bit of fish to be got to-day  lydia  my love  ring the bell   i 
      must speak to hill this moment     
 
         it is  not  mr  bingley     said her husband     it is a person whom 
      i never saw in the whole course of my life     
 
      this roused a general astonishment  and he had the pleasure of 
      being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at 
      once  
 
      after amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus 
      explained  
 
         about a month ago i received this letter  and about a fortnight 
      ago i answered it  for i thought it a case of some delicacy  and 
      requiring early attention  it is from my cousin  mr  collins  
      who  when i am dead  may turn you all out of this house as soon 
      as he pleases     
 
         oh  my dear     cried his wife     i cannot bear to hear that 
      mentioned  pray do not talk of that odious man  i do think it is 
      the hardest thing in the world  that your estate should be 
      entailed away from your own children  and i am sure  if i had 
      been you  i should have tried long ago to do something or other 
      about it     
 
      jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an 
      entail  they had often attempted to do it before  but it was a 
      subject on which mrs  bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and 
      she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an 
      estate away from a family of five daughters  in favour of a man 
      whom nobody cared anything about  
 
         it certainly is a most iniquitous affair     said mr  bennet     and 
      nothing can clear mr  collins from the guilt of inheriting 
      longbourn  but if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps 
      be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself     
 
         no  that i am sure i shall not  and i think it is very 
      impertinent of him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical  
      i hate such false friends  why could he not keep on quarreling 
      with you  as his father did before him     
 
         why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on 
      that head  as you will hear     
 
         hunsford  near westerham  kent  15 th october   
 
         dear sir     
         the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late 
      honoured father always gave me much uneasiness  and since i have 
      had the misfortune to lose him  i have frequently wished to heal 
      the breach  but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts  
      fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to 
      be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him 
      to be at variance       there  mrs  bennet       my mind  however  is now 
      made up on the subject  for having received ordination at easter  
      i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage 
      of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh  widow of sir 
      lewis de bourgh  whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to 
      the valuable rectory of this parish  where it shall be my earnest 
      endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her 
      ladyship  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies 
      which are instituted by the church of england  as a clergyman  
      moreover  i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing 
      of peace in all families within the reach of my influence  and on 
      these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are 
      highly commendable  and that the circumstance of my being next in 
      the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your 
      side  and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch  i 
      cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring 
      your amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for it  as 
      well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible 
      amends   but of this hereafter  if you should have no objection to 
      receive me into your house  i propose myself the satisfaction of 
      waiting on you and your family  monday  november 18th  by four 
      o   clock  and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the 
      saturday se   ennight following  which i can do without any 
      inconvenience  as lady catherine is far from objecting to my 
      occasional absence on a sunday  provided that some other 
      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day    i remain  dear 
      sir  with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters  your 
      well-wisher and friend  
 
         william collins    
 
         at four o   clock  therefore  we may expect this peace-making 
      gentleman     said mr  bennet  as he folded up the letter     he 
      seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man  upon my 
      word  and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance  
      especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him 
      come to us again     
 
         there is some sense in what he says about the girls  however  
      and if he is disposed to make them any amends  i shall not be the 
      person to discourage him     
 
         though it is difficult     said jane     to guess in what way he can 
      mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is 
      certainly to his credit     
 
      elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for 
      lady catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying  
      and burying his parishioners whenever it were required  
 
         he must be an oddity  i think     said she     i cannot make him 
      out    there is something very pompous in his style    and what can 
      he mean by apologising for being next in the entail    we cannot 
      suppose he would help it if he could    could he be a sensible man  
      sir     
 
         no  my dear  i think not  i have great hopes of finding him 
      quite the reverse  there is a mixture of servility and 
      self-importance in his letter  which promises well  i am 
      impatient to see him     
 
         in point of composition     said mary     the letter does not seem 
      defective  the idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly 
      new  yet i think it is well expressed     
 
      to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in 
      any degree interesting  it was next to impossible that their 
      cousin should come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks 
      since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any 
      other colour  as for their mother  mr  collins   s letter had done 
      away much of her ill-will  and she was preparing to see him with 
      a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters  
 
      mr  collins was punctual to his time  and was received with great 
      politeness by the whole family  mr  bennet indeed said little  
      but the ladies were ready enough to talk  and mr  collins seemed 
      neither in need of encouragement  nor inclined to be silent 
      himself  he was a tall  heavy-looking young man of 
      five-and-twenty  his air was grave and stately  and his manners 
      were very formal  he had not been long seated before he 
      complimented mrs  bennet on having so fine a family of daughters  
      said he had heard much of their beauty  but that in this instance 
      fame had fallen short of the truth  and added  that he did not 
      doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage  
      this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers  
      but mrs  bennet  who quarreled with no compliments  answered most 
      readily  
 
         you are very kind  i am sure  and i wish with all my heart it 
      may prove so  for else they will be destitute enough  things are 
      settled so oddly     
 
         you allude  perhaps  to the entail of this estate     
 
         ah  sir  i do indeed  it is a grievous affair to my poor girls  
      you must confess  not that i mean to find fault with  you   for 
      such things i know are all chance in this world  there is no 
      knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed     
 
         i am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins  
      and could say much on the subject  but that i am cautious of 
      appearing forward and precipitate  but i can assure the young 
      ladies that i come prepared to admire them  at present i will not 
      say more  but  perhaps  when we are better acquainted       
 
      he was interrupted by a summons to dinner  and the girls smiled 
      on each other  they were not the only objects of mr  collins   s 
      admiration  the hall  the dining-room  and all its furniture  
      were examined and praised  and his commendation of everything 
      would have touched mrs  bennet   s heart  but for the mortifying 
      supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property  the 
      dinner too in its turn was highly admired  and he begged to know 
      to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was 
      owing  but he was set right there by mrs  bennet  who assured him 
      with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good 
      cook  and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen  he 
      begged pardon for having displeased her  in a softened tone she 
      declared herself not at all offended  but he continued to 
      apologise for about a quarter of an hour  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 14 
 
      during dinner  mr  bennet scarcely spoke at all  but when the 
      servants were withdrawn  he thought it time to have some 
      conversation with his guest  and therefore started a subject in 
      which he expected him to shine  by observing that he seemed very 
      fortunate in his patroness  lady catherine de bourgh   s attention 
      to his wishes  and consideration for his comfort  appeared very 
      remarkable  mr  bennet could not have chosen better  mr  collins 
      was eloquent in her praise  the subject elevated him to more than 
      usual solemnity of manner  and with a most important aspect he 
      protested that    he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour 
      in a person of rank   such affability and condescension  as he had 
      himself experienced from lady catherine  she had been graciously 
      pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already 
      had the honour of preaching before her  she had also asked him 
      twice to dine at rosings  and had sent for him only the saturday 
      before  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening  lady 
      catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew  but  he  had 
      never seen anything but affability in her  she had always spoken 
      to him as she would to any other gentleman  she made not the 
      smallest objection to his joining in the society of the 
      neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a 
      week or two  to visit his relations  she had even condescended to 
      advise him to marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with 
      discretion  and had once paid him a visit in his humble 
      parsonage  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations 
      he had been making  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some 
      herself   some shelves in the closet up stairs     
 
         that is all very proper and civil  i am sure     said mrs  bennet  
         and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman  it is a pity that 
      great ladies in general are not more like her  does she live near 
      you  sir     
 
         the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by 
      a lane from rosings park  her ladyship   s residence     
 
         i think you said she was a widow  sir  has she any family     
 
         she has only one daughter  the heiress of rosings  and of very 
      extensive property     
 
         ah     said mrs  bennet  shaking her head     then she is better off 
      than many girls  and what sort of young lady is she  is she 
      handsome     
 
         she is a most charming young lady indeed  lady catherine herself 
      says that  in point of true beauty  miss de bourgh is far 
      superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in 
      her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth  
      she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution  which has 
      prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments 
      which she could not have otherwise failed of  as i am informed by 
      the lady who superintended her education  and who still resides 
      with them  but she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends to 
      drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies     
 
         has she been presented  i do not remember her name among the 
      ladies at court     
 
         her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in 
      town  and by that means  as i told lady catherine one day  has 
      deprived the british court of its brightest ornament  her 
      ladyship seemed pleased with the idea  and you may imagine that i 
      am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate 
      compliments which are always acceptable to ladies  i have more 
      than once observed to lady catherine  that her charming daughter 
      seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most elevated rank  
      instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by her  these 
      are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and it 
      is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound 
      to pay     
 
         you judge very properly     said mr  bennet     and it is happy for 
      you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy  may 
      i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse 
      of the moment  or are the result of previous study     
 
         they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though 
      i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such 
      little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary 
      occasions  i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as 
      possible     
 
      mr  bennet   s expectations were fully answered  his cousin was as 
      absurd as he had hoped  and he listened to him with the keenest 
      enjoyment  maintaining at the same time the most resolute 
      composure of countenance  and  except in an occasional glance at 
      elizabeth  requiring no partner in his pleasure  
 
      by tea-time  however  the dose had been enough  and mr  bennet 
      was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again  and  when 
      tea was over  glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies  mr  
      collins readily assented  and a book was produced  but  on 
      beholding it  for everything announced it to be from a 
      circulating library   he started back  and begging pardon  
      protested that he never read novels  kitty stared at him  and 
      lydia exclaimed  other books were produced  and after some 
      deliberation he chose fordyce   s sermons  lydia gaped as he opened 
      the volume  and before he had  with very monotonous solemnity  
      read three pages  she interrupted him with  
 
         do you know  mamma  that my uncle phillips talks of turning away 
      richard  and if he does  colonel forster will hire him  my aunt 
      told me so herself on saturday  i shall walk to meryton to-morrow 
      to hear more about it  and to ask when mr  denny comes back from 
      town     
 
      lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  but 
      mr  collins  much offended  laid aside his book  and said  
 
         i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by 
      books of a serious stamp  though written solely for their 
      benefit  it amazes me  i confess  for  certainly  there can be 
      nothing so advantageous to them as instruction  but i will no 
      longer importune my young cousin     
 
      then turning to mr  bennet  he offered himself as his antagonist 
      at backgammon  mr  bennet accepted the challenge  observing that 
      he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling 
      amusements  mrs  bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly 
      for lydia   s interruption  and promised that it should not occur 
      again  if he would resume his book  but mr  collins  after 
      assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will  and 
      should never resent her behaviour as any affront  seated himself 
      at another table with mr  bennet  and prepared for backgammon  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 15 
 
      mr  collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature 
      had been but little assisted by education or society  the 
      greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of 
      an illiterate and miserly father  and though he belonged to one 
      of the universities  he had merely kept the necessary terms  
      without forming at it any useful acquaintance  the subjection in 
      which his father had brought him up had given him originally 
      great humility of manner  but it was now a good deal counteracted 
      by the self-conceit of a weak head  living in retirement  and the 
      consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity  a 
      fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh 
      when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he 
      felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his 
      patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his 
      authority as a clergyman  and his right as a rector  made him 
      altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self-importance 
      and humility  
 
      having now a good house and a very sufficient income  he intended 
      to marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn 
      family he had a wife in view  as he meant to choose one of the 
      daughters  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were 
      represented by common report  this was his plan of amends   of 
      atonement   for inheriting their father   s estate  and he thought it 
      an excellent one  full of eligibility and suitableness  and 
      excessively generous and disinterested on his own part  
 
      his plan did not vary on seeing them  miss bennet   s lovely face 
      confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of 
      what was due to seniority  and for the first evening  she  was 
      his settled choice  the next morning  however  made an 
      alteration  for in a quarter of an hour   s  t  te-  -t  te  with mrs  
      bennet before breakfast  a conversation beginning with his 
      parsonage-house  and leading naturally to the avowal of his 
      hopes  that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn  
      produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general 
      encouragement  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on  
         as to her  younger  daughters  she could not take upon her to 
      say   she could not positively answer   but she did not  know  of any 
      prepossession  her  eldest  daughter  she must just mention   she 
      felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon 
      engaged     
 
      mr  collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth   and it was 
      soon done   done while mrs  bennet was stirring the fire  
      elizabeth  equally next to jane in birth and beauty  succeeded 
      her of course  
 
      mrs  bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might 
      soon have two daughters married  and the man whom she could not 
      bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces  
 
      lydia   s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten  every 
      sister except mary agreed to go with her  and mr  collins was to 
      attend them  at the request of mr  bennet  who was most anxious 
      to get rid of him  and have his library to himself  for thither 
      mr  collins had followed him after breakfast  and there he would 
      continue  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the 
      collection  but really talking to mr  bennet  with little 
      cessation  of his house and garden at hunsford  such doings 
      discomposed mr  bennet exceedingly  in his library he had been 
      always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as 
      he told elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other 
      room of the house  he was used to be free from them there  his 
      civility  therefore  was most prompt in inviting mr  collins to 
      join his daughters in their walk  and mr  collins  being in fact 
      much better fitted for a walker than a reader  was extremely 
      pleased to close his large book  and go  
 
      in pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his 
      cousins  their time passed till they entered meryton  the 
      attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by 
       him   their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in 
      quest of the officers  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet 
      indeed  or a really new muslin in a shop window  could recall 
      them  
 
      but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man  
      whom they had never seen before  of most gentlemanlike 
      appearance  walking with another officer on the other side of the 
      way  the officer was the very mr  denny concerning whose return 
      from london lydia came to enquire  and he bowed as they passed  
      all were struck with the stranger   s air  all wondered who he 
      could be  and kitty and lydia  determined if possible to find 
      out  led the way across the street  under pretense of wanting 
      something in an opposite shop  and fortunately had just gained 
      the pavement when the two gentlemen  turning back  had reached 
      the same spot  mr  denny addressed them directly  and entreated 
      permission to introduce his friend  mr  wickham  who had returned 
      with him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had 
      accepted a commission in their corps  this was exactly as it 
      should be  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him 
      completely charming  his appearance was greatly in his favour  he 
      had all the best part of beauty  a fine countenance  a good 
      figure  and very pleasing address  the introduction was followed 
      up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation   a readiness 
      at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  and the whole 
      party were still standing and talking together very agreeably  
      when the sound of horses drew their notice  and darcy and bingley 
      were seen riding down the street  on distinguishing the ladies of 
      the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and 
      began the usual civilities  bingley was the principal spokesman  
      and miss bennet the principal object  he was then  he said  on 
      his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her  mr  darcy 
      corroborated it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to 
      fix his eyes on elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by 
      the sight of the stranger  and elizabeth happening to see the 
      countenance of both as they looked at each other  was all 
      astonishment at the effect of the meeting  both changed colour  
      one looked white  the other red  mr  wickham  after a few 
      moments  touched his hat   a salutation which mr  darcy just 
      deigned to return  what could be the meaning of it  it was 
      impossible to imagine  it was impossible not to long to know  
 
      in another minute  mr  bingley  but without seeming to have 
      noticed what passed  took leave and rode on with his friend  
 
      mr  denny and mr  wickham walked with the young ladies to the 
      door of mr  phillip   s house  and then made their bows  in spite 
      of miss lydia   s pressing entreaties that they should come in  and 
      even in spite of mrs  phillips   s throwing up the parlour window 
      and loudly seconding the invitation  
 
      mrs  phillips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two 
      eldest  from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and 
      she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return 
      home  which  as their own carriage had not fetched them  she 
      should have known nothing about  if she had not happened to see 
      mr  jones   s shop-boy in the street  who had told her that they 
      were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the 
      miss bennets were come away  when her civility was claimed 
      towards mr  collins by jane   s introduction of him  she received 
      him with her very best politeness  which he returned with as much 
      more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous 
      acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering 
      himself  however  might be justified by his relationship to the 
      young ladies who introduced him to her notice  mrs  phillips was 
      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  but her 
      contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by 
      exclamations and enquiries about the other  of whom  however  she 
      could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that mr  denny 
      had brought him from london  and that he was to have a 
      lieutenant   s commission in the       shire  she had been watching him 
      the last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and 
      had mr  wickham appeared  kitty and lydia would certainly have 
      continued the occupation  but unluckily no one passed windows now 
      except a few of the officers  who  in comparison with the 
      stranger  were become    stupid  disagreeable fellows     some of 
      them were to dine with the phillipses the next day  and their 
      aunt promised to make her husband call on mr  wickham  and give 
      him an invitation also  if the family from longbourn would come 
      in the evening  this was agreed to  and mrs  phillips protested 
      that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery 
      tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards  the prospect 
      of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual 
      good spirits  mr  collins repeated his apologies in quitting the 
      room  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were 
      perfectly needless  
 
      as they walked home  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen 
      pass between the two gentlemen  but though jane would have 
      defended either or both  had they appeared to be in the wrong  
      she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister  
 
      mr  collins on his return highly gratified mrs  bennet by 
      admiring mrs  phillips   s manners and politeness  he protested 
      that  except lady catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a 
      more elegant woman  for she had not only received him with the 
      utmost civility  but even pointedly included him in her 
      invitation for the next evening  although utterly unknown to her 
      before  something  he supposed  might be attributed to his 
      connection with them  but yet he had never met with so much 
      attention in the whole course of his life  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 16 
 
      as no objection was made to the young people   s engagement with 
      their aunt  and all mr  collins   s scruples of leaving mr  and 
      mrs  bennet for a single evening during his visit were most 
      steadily resisted  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at 
      a suitable hour to meryton  and the girls had the pleasure of 
      hearing  as they entered the drawing-room  that mr  wickham had 
      accepted their uncle   s invitation  and was then in the house  
 
      when this information was given  and they had all taken their 
      seats  mr  collins was at leisure to look around him and admire  
      and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the 
      apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself 
      in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  a comparison 
      that did not at first convey much gratification  but when mrs  
      phillips understood from him what rosings was  and who was its 
      proprietor   when she had listened to the description of only one 
      of lady catherine   s drawing-rooms  and found that the 
      chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all 
      the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a 
      comparison with the housekeeper   s room  
 
      in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her 
      mansion  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble 
      abode  and the improvements it was receiving  he was happily 
      employed until the gentlemen joined them  and he found in mrs  
      phillips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his 
      consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving 
      to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could  to 
      the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  and who had 
      nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine their 
      own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece  the 
      interval of waiting appeared very long  it was over at last  
      however  the gentlemen did approach  and when mr  wickham walked 
      into the room  elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing 
      him before  nor thinking of him since  with the smallest degree 
      of unreasonable admiration  the officers of the       shire were in 
      general a very creditable  gentlemanlike set  and the best of 
      them were of the present party  but mr  wickham was as far beyond 
      them all in person  countenance  air  and walk  as  they  were 
      superior to the broad-faced  stuffy uncle phillips  breathing 
      port wine  who followed them into the room  
 
      mr  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female 
      eye was turned  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he 
      finally seated himself  and the agreeable manner in which he 
      immediately fell into conversation  though it was only on its 
      being a wet night  made her feel that the commonest  dullest  
      most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill 
      of the speaker  
 
      with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr  wickham and 
      the officers  mr  collins seemed to sink into insignificance  to 
      the young ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at 
      intervals a kind listener in mrs  phillips  and was by her 
      watchfulness  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin  
      when the card-tables were placed  he had the opportunity of 
      obliging her in turn  by sitting down to whist  
 
         i know little of the game at present     said he     but i shall be 
      glad to improve myself  for in my situation in life       mrs  
      phillips was very glad for his compliance  but could not wait for 
      his reason  
 
      mr  wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he 
      received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia  at first 
      there seemed danger of lydia   s engrossing him entirely  for she 
      was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond 
      of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the 
      game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to 
      have attention for anyone in particular  allowing for the common 
      demands of the game  mr  wickham was therefore at leisure to talk 
      to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what 
      she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told   the 
      history of his acquaintance with mr  darcy  she dared not even 
      mention that gentleman  her curiosity  however  was unexpectedly 
      relieved  mr  wickham began the subject himself  he enquired how 
      far netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her 
      answer  asked in a hesitating manner how long mr  darcy had been 
      staying there  
 
         about a month     said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the 
      subject drop  added     he is a man of very large property in 
      derbyshire  i understand     
 
         yes     replied mr  wickham     his estate there is a noble one  a 
      clear ten thousand per annum  you could not have met with a 
      person more capable of giving you certain information on that 
      head than myself  for i have been connected with his family in a 
      particular manner from my infancy     
 
      elizabeth could not but look surprised  
 
         you may well be surprised  miss bennet  at such an assertion  
      after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our 
      meeting yesterday  are you much acquainted with mr  darcy     
 
         as much as i ever wish to be     cried elizabeth very warmly     i 
      have spent four days in the same house with him  and i think him 
      very disagreeable     
 
         i have no right to give  my  opinion     said wickham     as to his 
      being agreeable or otherwise  i am not qualified to form one  i 
      have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge  it is 
      impossible for  me  to be impartial  but i believe your opinion 
      of him would in general astonish   and perhaps you would not 
      express it quite so strongly anywhere else  here you are in your 
      own family     
 
         upon my word  i say no more  here  than i might say in any house 
      in the neighbourhood  except netherfield  he is not at all liked 
      in hertfordshire  everybody is disgusted with his pride  you will 
      not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone     
 
         i cannot pretend to be sorry     said wickham  after a short 
      interruption     that he or that any man should not be estimated 
      beyond their deserts  but with  him  i believe it does not often 
      happen  the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or 
      frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as 
      he chooses to be seen     
 
         i should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an 
      ill-tempered man     wickham only shook his head  
 
         i wonder     said he  at the next opportunity of speaking  
         whether he is likely to be in this country much longer     
 
         i do not at all know  but i  heard  nothing of his going away 
      when i was at netherfield  i hope your plans in favour of the 
            shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood     
 
         oh  no   it is not for  me  to be driven away by mr  darcy  if 
       he  wishes to avoid seeing  me   he must go  we are not on 
      friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but i 
      have no reason for avoiding  him  but what i might proclaim 
      before all the world  a sense of very great ill-usage  and most 
      painful regrets at his being what he is  his father  miss bennet  
      the late mr  darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed  
      and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never be in company 
      with this mr  darcy without being grieved to the soul by a 
      thousand tender recollections  his behaviour to myself has been 
      scandalous  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and 
      everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and 
      disgracing the memory of his father     
 
      elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and 
      listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented 
      further enquiry  
 
      mr  wickham began to speak on more general topics  meryton  the 
      neighbourhood  the society  appearing highly pleased with all 
      that he had yet seen  and speaking of the latter with gentle but 
      very intelligible gallantry  
 
         it was the prospect of constant society  and good society     he 
      added     which was my chief inducement to enter the       shire  i 
      knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend 
      denny tempted me further by his account of their present 
      quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent 
      acquaintances meryton had procured them  society  i own  is 
      necessary to me  i have been a disappointed man  and my spirits 
      will not bear solitude  i  must  have employment and society  a 
      military life is not what i was intended for  but circumstances 
      have now made it eligible  the church  ought  to have been my 
      profession   i was brought up for the church  and i should at this 
      time have been in possession of a most valuable living  had it 
      pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now     
 
         indeed     
 
         yes   the late mr  darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of 
      the best living in his gift  he was my godfather  and excessively 
      attached to me  i cannot do justice to his kindness  he meant to 
      provide for me amply  and thought he had done it  but when the 
      living fell  it was given elsewhere     
 
         good heavens     cried elizabeth     but how could  that  be  how 
      could his will be disregarded  why did you not seek legal 
      redress     
 
         there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest 
      as to give me no hope from law  a man of honour could not have 
      doubted the intention  but mr  darcy chose to doubt it   or to 
      treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert 
      that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance  
      imprudence   in short anything or nothing  certain it is  that the 
      living became vacant two years ago  exactly as i was of an age to 
      hold it  and that it was given to another man  and no less 
      certain is it  that i cannot accuse myself of having really done 
      anything to deserve to lose it  i have a warm  unguarded temper  
      and i may have spoken my opinion  of  him  and  to  him  too 
      freely  i can recall nothing worse  but the fact is  that we are 
      very different sort of men  and that he hates me     
 
         this is quite shocking  he deserves to be publicly disgraced     
 
         some time or other he  will  be   but it shall not be by  me   
      till i can forget his father  i can never defy or expose  him      
 
      elizabeth honoured him for such feelings  and thought him 
      handsomer than ever as he expressed them  
 
         but what     said she  after a pause     can have been his motive  
      what can have induced him to behave so cruelly     
 
         a thorough  determined dislike of me   a dislike which i cannot 
      but attribute in some measure to jealousy  had the late mr  darcy 
      liked me less  his son might have borne with me better  but his 
      father   s uncommon attachment to me irritated him  i believe  very 
      early in life  he had not a temper to bear the sort of 
      competition in which we stood   the sort of preference which was 
      often given me     
 
         i had not thought mr  darcy so bad as this   though i have never 
      liked him  i had not thought so very ill of him  i had supposed 
      him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general  but did not 
      suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such 
      injustice  such inhumanity as this     
 
      after a few minutes    reflection  however  she continued     i  do  
      remember his boasting one day  at netherfield  of the 
      implacability of his resentments  of his having an unforgiving 
      temper  his disposition must be dreadful     
 
         i will not trust myself on the subject     replied wickham      i  
      can hardly be just to him     
 
      elizabeth was again deep in thought  and after a time exclaimed  
         to treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  the favourite 
      of his father     she could have added     a young man  too  like 
       you   whose very countenance may vouch for your being 
      amiable      but she contented herself with     and one  too  who had 
      probably been his companion from childhood  connected together  
      as i think you said  in the closest manner     
 
         we were born in the same parish  within the same park  the 
      greatest part of our youth was passed together  inmates of the 
      same house  sharing the same amusements  objects of the same 
      parental care   my  father began life in the profession which 
      your uncle  mr  phillips  appears to do so much credit to   but he 
      gave up everything to be of use to the late mr  darcy and devoted 
      all his time to the care of the pemberley property  he was most 
      highly esteemed by mr  darcy  a most intimate  confidential 
      friend  mr  darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the 
      greatest obligations to my father   s active superintendence  and 
      when  immediately before my father   s death  mr  darcy gave him a 
      voluntary promise of providing for me  i am convinced that he 
      felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to  him   as of his 
      affection to myself     
 
         how strange     cried elizabeth     how abominable  i wonder that 
      the very pride of this mr  darcy has not made him just to you  if 
      from no better motive  that he should not have been too proud to 
      be dishonest   for dishonesty i must call it     
 
         it  is  wonderful     replied wickham     for almost all his actions 
      may be traced to pride  and pride had often been his best friend  
      it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other 
      feeling  but we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour 
      to me there were stronger impulses even than pride     
 
         can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good     
 
         yes  it has often led him to be liberal and generous  to give 
      his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants  
      and relieve the poor  family pride  and  filial  pride   for he is 
      very proud of what his father was   have done this  not to appear 
      to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities  
      or lose the influence of the pemberley house  is a powerful 
      motive  he has also  brotherly  pride  which  with  some  
      brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian 
      of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the 
      most attentive and best of brothers     
 
         what sort of girl is miss darcy     
 
      he shook his head     i wish i could call her amiable  it gives me 
      pain to speak ill of a darcy  but she is too much like her 
      brother   very  very proud  as a child  she was affectionate and 
      pleasing  and extremely fond of me  and i have devoted hours and 
      hours to her amusement  but she is nothing to me now  she is a 
      handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  and  i understand  
      highly accomplished  since her father   s death  her home has been 
      london  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her 
      education     
 
      after many pauses and many trials of other subjects  elizabeth 
      could not help reverting once more to the first  and saying  
 
         i am astonished at his intimacy with mr  bingley  how can mr  
      bingley  who seems good humour itself  and is  i really believe  
      truly amiable  be in friendship with such a man  how can they 
      suit each other  do you know mr  bingley     
 
         not at all     
 
         he is a sweet-tempered  amiable  charming man  he cannot know 
      what mr  darcy is     
 
         probably not  but mr  darcy can please where he chooses  he does 
      not want abilities  he can be a conversible companion if he 
      thinks it worth his while  among those who are at all his equals 
      in consequence  he is a very different man from what he is to the 
      less prosperous  his pride never deserts him  but with the rich 
      he is liberal-minded  just  sincere  rational  honourable  and 
      perhaps agreeable   allowing something for fortune and figure     
 
      the whist party soon afterwards breaking up  the players gathered 
      round the other table and mr  collins took his station between 
      his cousin elizabeth and mrs  phillips  the usual enquiries as to 
      his success were made by the latter  it had not been very great  
      he had lost every point  but when mrs  phillips began to express 
      her concern thereupon  he assured her with much earnest gravity 
      that it was not of the least importance  that he considered the 
      money as a mere trifle  and begged that she would not make 
      herself uneasy  
 
         i know very well  madam     said he     that when persons sit down 
      to a card-table  they must take their chances of these things  
      and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five 
      shillings any object  there are undoubtedly many who could not 
      say the same  but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh  i am 
      removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters     
 
      mr  wickham   s attention was caught  and after observing mr  
      collins for a few moments  he asked elizabeth in a low voice 
      whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the 
      family of de bourgh  
 
         lady catherine de bourgh     she replied     has very lately given 
      him a living  i hardly know how mr  collins was first introduced 
      to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long     
 
         you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne 
      darcy were sisters  consequently that she is aunt to the present 
      mr  darcy     
 
         no  indeed  i did not  i knew nothing at all of lady catherine   s 
      connections  i never heard of her existence till the day before 
      yesterday     
 
         her daughter  miss de bourgh  will have a very large fortune  
      and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two 
      estates     
 
      this information made elizabeth smile  as she thought of poor 
      miss bingley  vain indeed must be all her attentions  vain and 
      useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself  
      if he were already self-destined for another  
 
         mr  collins     said she     speaks highly both of lady catherine 
      and her daughter  but from some particulars that he has related 
      of her ladyship  i suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that 
      in spite of her being his patroness  she is an arrogant  
      conceited woman     
 
         i believe her to be both in a great degree     replied wickham     i 
      have not seen her for many years  but i very well remember that i 
      never liked her  and that her manners were dictatorial and 
      insolent  she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and 
      clever  but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities 
      from her rank and fortune  part from her authoritative manner  
      and the rest from the pride of her nephew  who chooses that 
      everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the 
      first class     
 
      elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of 
      it  and they continued talking together  with mutual satisfaction 
      till supper put an end to cards  and gave the rest of the ladies 
      their share of mr  wickham   s attentions  there could be no 
      conversation in the noise of mrs  phillips   s supper party  but 
      his manners recommended him to everybody  whatever he said  was 
      said well  and whatever he did  done gracefully  elizabeth went 
      away with her head full of him  she could think of nothing but of 
      mr  wickham  and of what he had told her  all the way home  but 
      there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went  
      for neither lydia nor mr  collins were once silent  lydia talked 
      incessantly of lottery tickets  of the fish she had lost and the 
      fish she had won  and mr  collins in describing the civility of 
      mr  and mrs  phillips  protesting that he did not in the least 
      regard his losses at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper  
      and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins  had more to 
      say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at 
      longbourn house  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 17 
 
      elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between 
      mr  wickham and herself  jane listened with astonishment and 
      concern  she knew not how to believe that mr  darcy could be so 
      unworthy of mr  bingley   s regard  and yet  it was not in her 
      nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable 
      appearance as wickham  the possibility of his having endured such 
      unkindness  was enough to interest all her tender feelings  and 
      nothing remained therefore to be done  but to think well of them 
      both  to defend the conduct of each  and throw into the account 
      of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained  
 
         they have both     said she     been deceived  i dare say  in some 
      way or other  of which we can form no idea  interested people 
      have perhaps misrepresented each to the other  it is  in short  
      impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which 
      may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side     
 
         very true  indeed  and now  my dear jane  what have you got to 
      say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been 
      concerned in the business  do clear  them  too  or we shall be 
      obliged to think ill of somebody     
 
         laugh as much as you choose  but you will not laugh me out of my 
      opinion  my dearest lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful 
      light it places mr  darcy  to be treating his father   s favourite 
      in such a manner  one whom his father had promised to provide 
      for  it is impossible  no man of common humanity  no man who had 
      any value for his character  could be capable of it  can his most 
      intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him  oh  no     
 
         i can much more easily believe mr  bingley   s being imposed on  
      than that mr  wickham should invent such a history of himself as 
      he gave me last night  names  facts  everything mentioned without 
      ceremony  if it be not so  let mr  darcy contradict it  besides  
      there was truth in his looks     
 
         it is difficult indeed   it is distressing  one does not know what 
      to think     
 
         i beg your pardon  one knows exactly what to think     
 
      but jane could think with certainty on only one point   that mr  
      bingley  if he  had been  imposed on  would have much to suffer 
      when the affair became public  
 
      the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery  where this 
      conversation passed  by the arrival of the very persons of whom 
      they had been speaking  mr  bingley and his sisters came to give 
      their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at 
      netherfield  which was fixed for the following tuesday  the two 
      ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again  called it 
      an age since they had met  and repeatedly asked what she had been 
      doing with herself since their separation  to the rest of the 
      family they paid little attention  avoiding mrs  bennet as much 
      as possible  saying not much to elizabeth  and nothing at all to 
      the others  they were soon gone again  rising from their seats 
      with an activity which took their brother by surprise  and 
      hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs  bennet   s civilities  
 
      the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to 
      every female of the family  mrs  bennet chose to consider it as 
      given in compliment to her eldest daughter  and was particularly 
      flattered by receiving the invitation from mr  bingley himself  
      instead of a ceremonious card  jane pictured to herself a happy 
      evening in the society of her two friends  and the attentions of 
      their brother  and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a 
      great deal with mr  wickham  and of seeing a confirmation of 
      everything in mr  darcy   s look and behaviour  the happiness 
      anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single 
      event  or any particular person  for though they each  like 
      elizabeth  meant to dance half the evening with mr  wickham  he 
      was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them  and a 
      ball was  at any rate  a ball  and even mary could assure her 
      family that she had no disinclination for it  
 
         while i can have my mornings to myself     said she     it is 
      enough   i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening 
      engagements  society has claims on us all  and i profess myself 
      one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement 
      as desirable for everybody     
 
      elizabeth   s spirits were so high on this occasion  that though 
      she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr  collins  she could 
      not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr  bingley   s 
      invitation  and if he did  whether he would think it proper to 
      join in the evening   s amusement  and she was rather surprised to 
      find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head  and 
      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop  
      or lady catherine de bourgh  by venturing to dance  
 
         i am by no means of the opinion  i assure you     said he     that a 
      ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to 
      respectable people  can have any evil tendency  and i am so far 
      from objecting to dancing myself  that i shall hope to be 
      honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of 
      the evening  and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours  
      miss elizabeth  for the two first dances especially  a preference 
      which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause  
      and not to any disrespect for her     
 
      elizabeth felt herself completely taken in  she had fully 
      proposed being engaged by mr  wickham for those very dances  and 
      to have mr  collins instead  her liveliness had never been worse 
      timed  there was no help for it  however  mr  wickham   s happiness 
      and her own were perforce delayed a little longer  and mr  
      collins   s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could  
      she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea 
      it suggested of something more  it now first struck her  that 
       she  was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being 
      mistress of hunsford parsonage  and of assisting to form a 
      quadrille table at rosings  in the absence of more eligible 
      visitors  the idea soon reached to conviction  as she observed 
      his increasing civilities toward herself  and heard his frequent 
      attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  and though more 
      astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms  
      it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the 
      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to  her   
      elizabeth  however  did not choose to take the hint  being well 
      aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any 
      reply  mr  collins might never make the offer  and till he did  
      it was useless to quarrel about him  
 
      if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk 
      of  the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable 
      state at this time  for from the day of the invitation  to the 
      day of the ball  there was such a succession of rain as prevented 
      their walking to meryton once  no aunt  no officers  no news 
      could be sought after   the very shoe-roses for netherfield were 
      got by proxy  even elizabeth might have found some trial of her 
      patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of 
      her acquaintance with mr  wickham  and nothing less than a dance 
      on tuesday  could have made such a friday  saturday  sunday  and 
      monday endurable to kitty and lydia  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 18 
 
      till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield  and 
      looked in vain for mr  wickham among the cluster of red coats 
      there assembled  a doubt of his being present had never occurred 
      to her  the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any 
      of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed 
      her  she had dressed with more than usual care  and prepared in 
      the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained 
      unsubdued of his heart  trusting that it was not more than might 
      be won in the course of the evening  but in an instant arose the 
      dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr  darcy   s 
      pleasure in the bingleys    invitation to the officers  and though 
      this was not exactly the case  the absolute fact of his absence 
      was pronounced by his friend denny  to whom lydia eagerly 
      applied  and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to 
      town on business the day before  and was not yet returned  
      adding  with a significant smile     i do not imagine his business 
      would have called him away just now  if he had not wanted to 
      avoid a certain gentleman here     
 
      this part of his intelligence  though unheard by lydia  was 
      caught by elizabeth  and  as it assured her that darcy was not 
      less answerable for wickham   s absence than if her first surmise 
      had been just  every feeling of displeasure against the former 
      was so sharpened by immediate disappointment  that she could 
      hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries 
      which he directly afterwards approached to make  attendance  
      forbearance  patience with darcy  was injury to wickham  she was 
      resolved against any sort of conversation with him  and turned 
      away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly 
      surmount even in speaking to mr  bingley  whose blind partiality 
      provoked her  
 
      but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour  and though every 
      prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening  it could not 
      dwell long on her spirits  and having told all her griefs to 
      charlotte lucas  whom she had not seen for a week  she was soon 
      able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her 
      cousin  and to point him out to her particular notice  the first 
      two dances  however  brought a return of distress  they were 
      dances of mortification  mr  collins  awkward and solemn  
      apologising instead of attending  and often moving wrong without 
      being aware of it  gave her all the shame and misery which a 
      disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give  the moment 
      of her release from him was ecstasy  
 
      she danced next with an officer  and had the refreshment of 
      talking of wickham  and of hearing that he was universally liked  
      when those dances were over  she returned to charlotte lucas  and 
      was in conversation with her  when she found herself suddenly 
      addressed by mr  darcy who took her so much by surprise in his 
      application for her hand  that  without knowing what she did  she 
      accepted him  he walked away again immediately  and she was left 
      to fret over her own want of presence of mind  charlotte tried to 
      console her  
 
         i dare say you will find him very agreeable     
 
         heaven forbid   that  would be the greatest misfortune of all  
      to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate  do not 
      wish me such an evil     
 
      when the dancing recommenced  however  and darcy approached to 
      claim her hand  charlotte could not help cautioning her in a 
      whisper  not to be a simpleton  and allow her fancy for wickham 
      to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his 
      consequence  elizabeth made no answer  and took her place in the 
      set  amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being 
      allowed to stand opposite to mr  darcy  and reading in her 
      neighbours    looks  their equal amazement in beholding it  they 
      stood for some time without speaking a word  and she began to 
      imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances  
      and at first was resolved not to break it  till suddenly fancying 
      that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige 
      him to talk  she made some slight observation on the dance  he 
      replied  and was again silent  after a pause of some minutes  she 
      addressed him a second time with       it is  your  turn to say 
      something now  mr  darcy   i  talked about the dance  and  you  
      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room  or the 
      number of couples     
 
      he smiled  and assured her that whatever she wished him to say 
      should be said  
 
         very well  that reply will do for the present  perhaps by and by 
      i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public 
      ones  but  now  we may be silent     
 
         do you talk by rule  then  while you are dancing     
 
         sometimes  one must speak a little  you know  it would look odd 
      to be entirely silent for half an hour together  and yet for the 
      advantage of  some   conversation ought to be so arranged  as 
      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible     
 
         are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do 
      you imagine that you are gratifying mine     
 
         both     replied elizabeth archly     for i have always seen a great 
      similarity in the turn of our minds  we are each of an unsocial  
      taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say 
      something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to 
      posterity with all the    clat  of a proverb     
 
         this is no very striking resemblance of your own character  i am 
      sure     said he     how near it may be to  mine   i cannot pretend 
      to say   you  think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly     
 
         i must not decide on my own performance     
 
      he made no answer  and they were again silent till they had gone 
      down the dance  when he asked her if she and her sisters did not 
      very often walk to meryton  she answered in the affirmative  and  
      unable to resist the temptation  added     when you met us there 
      the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance     
 
      the effect was immediate  a deeper shade of  hauteur  overspread 
      his features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though 
      blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on  at length 
      darcy spoke  and in a constrained manner said     mr  wickham is 
      blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his  making  
      friends   whether he may be equally capable of  retaining  them  is 
      less certain     
 
         he has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship     replied 
      elizabeth with emphasis     and in a manner which he is likely to 
      suffer from all his life     
 
      darcy made no answer  and seemed desirous of changing the 
      subject  at that moment  sir william lucas appeared close to 
      them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the 
      room  but on perceiving mr  darcy  he stopped with a bow of 
      superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his 
      partner  
 
         i have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir  such very 
      superior dancing is not often seen  it is evident that you belong 
      to the first circles  allow me to say  however  that your fair 
      partner does not disgrace you  and that i must hope to have this 
      pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable 
      event  my dear eliza  glancing at her sister and bingley  shall 
      take place  what congratulations will then flow in  i appeal to 
      mr  darcy    but let me not interrupt you  sir  you will not thank 
      me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young 
      lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me     
 
      the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but 
      sir william   s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him 
      forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious 
      expression towards bingley and jane  who were dancing together  
      recovering himself  however  shortly  he turned to his partner  
      and said     sir william   s interruption has made me forget what we 
      were talking of     
 
         i do not think we were speaking at all  sir william could not 
      have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for 
      themselves  we have tried two or three subjects already without 
      success  and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine     
 
         what think you of books     said he  smiling  
 
         books   oh  no  i am sure we never read the same  or not with the 
      same feelings     
 
         i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at 
      least be no want of subject  we may compare our different 
      opinions     
 
         no   i cannot talk of books in a ball-room  my head is always full 
      of something else     
 
         the  present  always occupies you in such scenes   does it     said 
      he  with a look of doubt  
 
         yes  always     she replied  without knowing what she said  for 
      her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon 
      afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming     i remember 
      hearing you once say  mr  darcy  that you hardly ever forgave  
      that your resentment once created was unappeasable  you are very 
      cautious  i suppose  as to its  being created      
 
         i am     said he  with a firm voice  
 
         and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice     
 
         i hope not     
 
         it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their 
      opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first     
 
         may i ask to what these questions tend     
 
         merely to the illustration of  your  character     said she  
      endeavouring to shake off her gravity     i am trying to make it 
      out     
 
         and what is your success     
 
      she shook her head     i do not get on at all  i hear such 
      different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly     
 
         i can readily believe     answered he gravely     that reports may 
      vary greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  miss bennet  
      that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment  
      as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no 
      credit on either     
 
         but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another 
      opportunity     
 
         i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours     he coldly 
      replied  she said no more  and they went down the other dance and 
      parted in silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to 
      an equal degree  for in darcy   s breast there was a tolerably 
      powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and 
      directed all his anger against another  
 
      they had not long separated  when miss bingley came towards her  
      and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her  
 
         so  miss eliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george 
      wickham  your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking 
      me a thousand questions  and i find that the young man quite 
      forgot to tell you  among his other communication  that he was 
      the son of old wickham  the late mr  darcy   s steward  let me 
      recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit 
      confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr  darcy   s using him 
      ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has always 
      been remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated 
      mr  darcy in a most infamous manner  i do not know the 
      particulars  but i know very well that mr  darcy is not in the 
      least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham 
      mentioned  and that though my brother thought that he could not 
      well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he 
      was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the 
      way  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing  
      indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it  i pity you  
      miss eliza  for this discovery of your favourite   s guilt  but 
      really  considering his descent  one could not expect much 
      better     
 
         his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the 
      same     said elizabeth angrily     for i have heard you accuse him 
      of nothing worse than of being the son of mr  darcy   s steward  
      and of  that   i can assure you  he informed me himself     
 
         i beg your pardon     replied miss bingley  turning away with a 
      sneer     excuse my interference   it was kindly meant     
 
         insolent girl     said elizabeth to herself     you are much 
      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as 
      this  i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the 
      malice of mr  darcy     she then sought her eldest sister  who had 
      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley  jane 
      met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such 
      happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was 
      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening  elizabeth 
      instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for 
      wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else  
      gave way before the hope of jane   s being in the fairest way for 
      happiness  
 
         i want to know     said she  with a countenance no less smiling 
      than her sister   s     what you have learnt about mr  wickham  but 
      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any 
      third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon     
 
         no     replied jane     i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing 
      satisfactory to tell you  mr  bingley does not know the whole of 
      his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which 
      have principally offended mr  darcy  but he will vouch for the 
      good conduct  the probity  and honour of his friend  and is 
      perfectly convinced that mr  wickham has deserved much less 
      attention from mr  darcy than he has received  and i am sorry to 
      say by his account as well as his sister   s  mr  wickham is by no 
      means a respectable young man  i am afraid he has been very 
      imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr  darcy   s regard     
 
         mr  bingley does not know mr  wickham himself     
 
         no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton     
 
         this account then is what he has received from mr  darcy  i am 
      satisfied  but what does he say of the living     
 
         he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has 
      heard them from mr  darcy more than once  but he believes that it 
      was left to him  conditionally  only     
 
         i have not a doubt of mr  bingley   s sincerity     said elizabeth 
      warmly     but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances 
      only  mr  bingley   s defense of his friend was a very able one  i 
      dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the 
      story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  i shall 
      venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before     
 
      she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each  
      and on which there could be no difference of sentiment  elizabeth 
      listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which 
      jane entertained of mr  bingley   s regard  and said all in her 
      power to heighten her confidence in it  on their being joined by 
      mr  bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas  to whose 
      enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had 
      scarcely replied  before mr  collins came up to them  and told 
      her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as 
      to make a most important discovery  
 
         i have found out     said he     by a singular accident  that there 
      is now in the room a near relation of my patroness  i happened to 
      overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who 
      does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de 
      bourgh  and of her mother lady catherine  how wonderfully these 
      sort of things occur  who would have thought of my meeting with  
      perhaps  a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly  i 
      am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay 
      my respects to him  which i am now going to do  and trust he will 
      excuse my not having done it before  my total ignorance of the 
      connection must plead my apology     
 
         you are not going to introduce yourself to mr  darcy     
 
         indeed i am  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it 
      earlier  i believe him to be lady catherine   s  nephew   it will 
      be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well 
      yesterday se   nnight     
 
      elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring 
      him that mr  darcy would consider his addressing him without 
      introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment 
      to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should 
      be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong 
      to mr  darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the 
      acquaintance  mr  collins listened to her with the determined air 
      of following his own inclination  and  when she ceased speaking  
      replied thus  
 
         my dear miss elizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world 
      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of 
      your understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a 
      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst 
      the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me 
      leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in 
      point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom   provided 
      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time 
      maintained  you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of 
      my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what i 
      look on as a point of duty  pardon me for neglecting to profit by 
      your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant 
      guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted 
      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a 
      young lady like yourself     and with a low bow he left her to 
      attack mr  darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly 
      watched  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very 
      evident  her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and 
      though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it 
      all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words    apology     
         hunsford     and    lady catherine de bourgh     it vexed her to see 
      him expose himself to such a man  mr  darcy was eyeing him with 
      unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr  collins allowed him 
      time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility  mr  
      collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and 
      mr  darcy   s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length 
      of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a 
      slight bow  and moved another way  mr  collins then returned to 
      elizabeth  
 
         i have no reason  i assure you     said he     to be dissatisfied 
      with my reception  mr  darcy seemed much pleased with the 
      attention  he answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid 
      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady 
      catherine   s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a 
      favour unworthily  it was really a very handsome thought  upon 
      the whole  i am much pleased with him     
 
      as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she 
      turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr  
      bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her 
      observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as 
      jane  she saw her in idea settled in that very house  in all the 
      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she 
      felt capable  under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to 
      like bingley   s two sisters  her mother   s thoughts she plainly saw 
      were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near 
      her  lest she might hear too much  when they sat down to supper  
      therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which 
      placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to 
      find that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas  
      freely  openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane 
      would soon be married to mr  bingley  it was an animating 
      subject  and mrs  bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while 
      enumerating the advantages of the match  his being such a 
      charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from 
      them  were the first points of self-gratulation  and then it was 
      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane  
      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as 
      she could do  it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her 
      younger daughters  as jane   s marrying so greatly must throw them 
      in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at 
      her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to 
      the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go 
      into company more than she liked  it was necessary to make this 
      circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on such occasions it 
      is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mrs  bennet to 
      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life  she 
      concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be 
      equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing 
      there was no chance of it  
 
      in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her 
      mother   s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a 
      less audible whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she 
      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr  darcy  
      who sat opposite to them  her mother only scolded her for being 
      nonsensical  
 
         what is mr  darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him  i 
      am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged 
      to say nothing  he  may not like to hear     
 
         for heaven   s sake  madam  speak lower  what advantage can it be 
      for you to offend mr  darcy  you will never recommend yourself to 
      his friend by so doing     
 
      nothing that she could say  however  had any influence  her 
      mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone  
      elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation  she 
      could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr  darcy  though 
      every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  for though he was 
      not always looking at her mother  she was convinced that his 
      attention was invariably fixed by her  the expression of his face 
      changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and 
      steady gravity  
 
      at length  however  mrs  bennet had no more to say  and lady 
      lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights 
      which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts 
      of cold ham and chicken  elizabeth now began to revive  but not 
      long was the interval of tranquillity  for  when supper was over  
      singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing 
      mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the 
      company  by many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she 
      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance  but in vain  
      mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting 
      was delightful to her  and she began her song  elizabeth   s eyes 
      were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched 
      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which 
      was very ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving  
      amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she 
      might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of 
      half a minute began another  mary   s powers were by no means 
      fitted for such a display  her voice was weak  and her manner 
      affected  elizabeth was in agonies  she looked at jane  to see 
      how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to bingley  
      she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs of 
      derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued  however  
      imperturbably grave  she looked at her father to entreat his 
      interference  lest mary should be singing all night  he took the 
      hint  and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud  
         that will do extremely well  child  you have delighted us long 
      enough  let the other young ladies have time to exhibit     
 
      mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted  
      and elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father   s speech  
      was afraid her anxiety had done no good  others of the party were 
      now applied to  
 
         if i     said mr  collins     were so fortunate as to be able to 
      sing  i should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the 
      company with an air  for i consider music as a very innocent 
      diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a 
      clergyman  i do not mean  however  to assert that we can be 
      justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there 
      are certainly other things to be attended to  the rector of a 
      parish has much to do  in the first place  he must make such an 
      agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not 
      offensive to his patron  he must write his own sermons  and the 
      time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and 
      the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be 
      excused from making as comfortable as possible  and i do not 
      think it of light importance that he should have attentive and 
      conciliatory manners towards everybody  especially towards those 
      to whom he owes his preferment  i cannot acquit him of that duty  
      nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of 
      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the 
      family     and with a bow to mr  darcy  he concluded his speech  
      which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room  
      many stared   many smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr  
      bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended mr  collins 
      for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half-whisper to 
      lady lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young 
      man  
 
      to elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement 
      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it 
      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more 
      spirit or finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley 
      and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his 
      notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much 
      distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed  that his 
      two sisters and mr  darcy  however  should have such an 
      opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough  and she 
      could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman  
      or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable  
 
      the rest of the evening brought her little amusement  she was 
      teased by mr  collins  who continued most perseveringly by her 
      side  and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him 
      again  put it out of her power to dance with others  in vain did 
      she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to 
      introduce him to any young lady in the room  he assured her  that 
      as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief 
      object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and 
      that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her 
      the whole evening  there was no arguing upon such a project  she 
      owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas  who often 
      joined them  and good-naturedly engaged mr  collins   s 
      conversation to herself  
 
      she was at least free from the offense of mr  darcy   s further 
      notice  though often standing within a very short distance of 
      her  quite disengaged  he never came near enough to speak  she 
      felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr  
      wickham  and rejoiced in it  
 
      the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  
      and  by a manoeuvre of mrs  bennet  had to wait for their 
      carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone  
      which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by 
      some of the family  mrs  hurst and her sister scarcely opened 
      their mouths  except to complain of fatigue  and were evidently 
      impatient to have the house to themselves  they repulsed every 
      attempt of mrs  bennet at conversation  and by so doing threw a 
      languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by 
      the long speeches of mr  collins  who was complimenting mr  
      bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment  
      and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their 
      behaviour to their guests  darcy said nothing at all  mr  bennet  
      in equal silence  was enjoying the scene  mr  bingley and jane 
      were standing together  a little detached from the rest  and 
      talked only to each other  elizabeth preserved as steady a 
      silence as either mrs  hurst or miss bingley  and even lydia was 
      too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation 
      of    lord  how tired i am     accompanied by a violent yawn  
 
      when at length they arose to take leave  mrs  bennet was most 
      pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at 
      longbourn  and addressed herself especially to mr  bingley  to 
      assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner 
      with them at any time  without the ceremony of a formal 
      invitation  bingley was all grateful pleasure  and he readily 
      engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her  
      after his return from london  whither he was obliged to go the 
      next day for a short time  
 
      mrs  bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under 
      the delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary 
      preparations of settlements  new carriages  and wedding clothes  
      she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in 
      the course of three or four months  of having another daughter 
      married to mr  collins  she thought with equal certainty  and 
      with considerable  though not equal  pleasure  elizabeth was the 
      least dear to her of all her children  and though the man and the 
      match were quite good enough for  her   the worth of each was 
      eclipsed by mr  bingley and netherfield  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 19 
 
      the next day opened a new scene at longbourn  mr  collins made 
      his declaration in form  having resolved to do it without loss of 
      time  as his leave of absence extended only to the following 
      saturday  and having no feelings of diffidence to make it 
      distressing to himself even at the moment  he set about it in a 
      very orderly manner  with all the observances  which he supposed 
      a regular part of the business  on finding mrs  bennet  
      elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together  soon after 
      breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words  
 
         may i hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter 
      elizabeth  when i solicit for the honour of a private audience 
      with her in the course of this morning     
 
      before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise  
      mrs  bennet answered instantly     oh dear    yes   certainly  i am 
      sure lizzy will be very happy   i am sure she can have no 
      objection  come  kitty  i want you up stairs     and  gathering her 
      work together  she was hastening away  when elizabeth called out  
 
         dear madam  do not go  i beg you will not go  mr  collins must 
      excuse me  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not 
      hear  i am going away myself     
 
         no  no  nonsense  lizzy  i desire you to stay where you are     
      and upon elizabeth   s seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed 
      looks  about to escape  she added     lizzy  i  insist  upon your 
      staying and hearing mr  collins     
 
      elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction   and a moment   s 
      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to 
      get it over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down 
      again and tried to conceal  by incessant employment the feelings 
      which were divided between distress and diversion  mrs  bennet 
      and kitty walked off  and as soon as they were gone  mr  collins 
      began  
 
         believe me  my dear miss elizabeth  that your modesty  so far 
      from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other 
      perfections  you would have been less amiable in my eyes had 
      there  not  been this little unwillingness  but allow me to 
      assure you  that i have your respected mother   s permission for 
      this address  you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse  
      however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble  my 
      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  almost as soon as 
      i entered the house  i singled you out as the companion of my 
      future life  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this 
      subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons 
      for marrying   and  moreover  for coming into hertfordshire with 
      the design of selecting a wife  as i certainly did     
 
      the idea of mr  collins  with all his solemn composure  being run 
      away with by his feelings  made elizabeth so near laughing  that 
      she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to 
      stop him further  and he continued  
 
         my reasons for marrying are  first  that i think it a right 
      thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to 
      set the example of matrimony in his parish  secondly  that i am 
      convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness  and 
      thirdly   which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier  that it 
      is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble 
      lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness  twice has she 
      condescended to give me her opinion  unasked too   on this 
      subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i left 
      hunsford   between our pools at quadrille  while mrs  jenkinson was 
      arranging miss de bourgh   s footstool  that she said     mr  
      collins  you must marry  a clergyman like you must marry  choose 
      properly  choose a gentlewoman for  my  sake  and for your  own   
      let her be an active  useful sort of person  not brought up high  
      but able to make a small income go a good way  this is my advice  
      find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to hunsford  and 
      i will visit her     allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair 
      cousin  that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady 
      catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my 
      power to offer  you will find her manners beyond anything i can 
      describe  and your wit and vivacity  i think  must be acceptable 
      to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect 
      which her rank will inevitably excite  thus much for my general 
      intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my 
      views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own 
      neighbourhood  where i can assure you there are many amiable 
      young women  but the fact is  that being  as i am  to inherit 
      this estate after the death of your honoured father  who  
      however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy myself 
      without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that 
      the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the 
      melancholy event takes place   which  however  as i have already 
      said  may not be for several years  this has been my motive  my 
      fair cousin  and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your 
      esteem  and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the 
      most animated language of the violence of my affection  to 
      fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of 
      that nature on your father  since i am well aware that it could 
      not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds in the four 
      per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother   s 
      decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  on that head  
      therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure 
      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when 
      we are married     
 
      it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now  
 
         you are too hasty  sir     she cried     you forget that i have made 
      no answer  let me do it without further loss of time  accept my 
      thanks for the compliment you are paying me  i am very sensible 
      of the honour of your proposals  but it is impossible for me to 
      do otherwise than to decline them     
 
         i am not now to learn     replied mr  collins  with a formal wave 
      of the hand     that it is usual with young ladies to reject the 
      addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he 
      first applies for their favour  and that sometimes the refusal is 
      repeated a second  or even a third time  i am therefore by no 
      means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to 
      lead you to the altar ere long     
 
         upon my word  sir     cried elizabeth     your hope is a rather 
      extraordinary one after my declaration  i do assure you that i am 
      not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  
      who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of 
      being asked a second time  i am perfectly serious in my refusal  
      you could not make  me  happy  and i am convinced that i am the 
      last woman in the world who could make you so  nay  were your 
      friend lady catherine to know me  i am persuaded she would find 
      me in every respect ill qualified for the situation     
 
         were it certain that lady catherine would think so     said mr  
      collins very gravely      but i cannot imagine that her ladyship 
      would at all disapprove of you  and you may be certain when i 
      have the honour of seeing her again  i shall speak in the very 
      highest terms of your modesty  economy  and other amiable 
      qualification     
 
         indeed  mr  collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  you 
      must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment 
      of believing what i say  i wish you very happy and very rich  and 
      by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being 
      otherwise  in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the 
      delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take 
      possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any 
      self-reproach  this matter may be considered  therefore  as 
      finally settled     and rising as she thus spoke  she would have 
      quitted the room  had mr  collins not thus addressed her  
 
         when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the 
      subject  i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than 
      you have now given me  though i am far from accusing you of 
      cruelty at present  because i know it to be the established 
      custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and 
      perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as 
      would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female 
      character     
 
         really  mr  collins     cried elizabeth with some warmth     you 
      puzzle me exceedingly  if what i have hitherto said can appear to 
      you in the form of encouragement  i know not how to express my 
      refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one     
 
         you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that 
      your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  my 
      reasons for believing it are briefly these  it does not appear to 
      me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance  or that the 
      establishment i can offer would be any other than highly 
      desirable  my situation in life  my connections with the family 
      of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances 
      highly in my favour  and you should take it into further 
      consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is 
      by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be 
      made you  your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all 
      likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable 
      qualifications  as i must therefore conclude that you are not 
      serious in your rejection of me  i shall choose to attribute it 
      to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the 
      usual practice of elegant females     
 
         i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretensions whatever to 
      that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable 
      man  i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed 
      sincere  i thank you again and again for the honour you have done 
      me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely 
      impossible  my feelings in every respect forbid it  can i speak 
      plainer  do not consider me now as an elegant female  intending 
      to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking the truth 
      from her heart     
 
         you are uniformly charming     cried he  with an air of awkward 
      gallantry     and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the 
      express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals 
      will not fail of being acceptable     
 
      to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would 
      make no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew  
      determined  if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals 
      as flattering encouragement  to apply to her father  whose 
      negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive  and 
      whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the 
      affectation and coquetry of an elegant female  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 20 
 
      mr  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his 
      successful love  for mrs  bennet  having dawdled about in the 
      vestibule to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw 
      elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the 
      staircase  than she entered the breakfast-room  and congratulated 
      both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their 
      nearer connection  mr  collins received and returned these 
      felicitations with equal pleasure  and then proceeded to relate 
      the particulars of their interview  with the result of which he 
      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the refusal 
      which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow 
      from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her 
      character  
 
      this information  however  startled mrs  bennet  she would have 
      been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to 
      encourage him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared 
      not believe it  and could not help saying so  
 
         but  depend upon it  mr  collins     she added     that lizzy shall 
      be brought to reason  i will speak to her about it directly  she 
      is a very headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own 
      interest but i will  make  her know it     
 
         pardon me for interrupting you  madam     cried mr  collins     but 
      if she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she 
      would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my 
      situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage 
      state  if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit  
      perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me  
      because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not 
      contribute much to my felicity     
 
         sir  you quite misunderstand me     said mrs  bennet  alarmed  
         lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these  in everything 
      else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived  i will go 
      directly to mr  bennet  and we shall very soon settle it with 
      her  i am sure     
 
      she would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to 
      her husband  called out as she entered the library     oh  mr  
      bennet  you are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar  you 
      must come and make lizzy marry mr  collins  for she vows she will 
      not have him  and if you do not make haste he will change his 
      mind and not have  her      
 
      mr  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and 
      fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the 
      least altered by her communication  
 
         i have not the pleasure of understanding you     said he  when she 
      had finished her speech     of what are you talking     
 
         of mr  collins and lizzy  lizzy declares she will not have mr  
      collins  and mr  collins begins to say that he will not have 
      lizzy     
 
         and what am i to do on the occasion  it seems an hopeless 
      business     
 
         speak to lizzy about it yourself  tell her that you insist upon 
      her marrying him     
 
         let her be called down  she shall hear my opinion     
 
      mrs  bennet rang the bell  and miss elizabeth was summoned to the 
      library  
 
         come here  child     cried her father as she appeared     i have 
      sent for you on an affair of importance  i understand that mr  
      collins has made you an offer of marriage  is it true     elizabeth 
      replied that it was     very well   and this offer of marriage you 
      have refused     
 
         i have  sir     
 
         very well  we now come to the point  your mother insists upon 
      your accepting it  is it not so  mrs  bennet     
 
         yes  or i will never see her again     
 
         an unhappy alternative is before you  elizabeth  from this day 
      you must be a stranger to one of your parents  your mother will 
      never see you again if you do  not  marry mr  collins  and i will 
      never see you again if you  do      
 
      elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a 
      beginning  but mrs  bennet  who had persuaded herself that her 
      husband regarded the affair as she wished  was excessively 
      disappointed  
 
         what do you mean  mr  bennet  in talking this way  you promised 
      me to  insist  upon her marrying him     
 
         my dear     replied her husband     i have two small favours to 
      request  first  that you will allow me the free use of my 
      understanding on the present occasion  and secondly  of my room  
      i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be     
 
      not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband  
      did mrs  bennet give up the point  she talked to elizabeth again 
      and again  coaxed and threatened her by turns  she endeavoured to 
      secure jane in her interest  but jane  with all possible 
      mildness  declined interfering  and elizabeth  sometimes with 
      real earnestness  and sometimes with playful gaiety  replied to 
      her attacks  though her manner varied  however  her determination 
      never did  
 
      mr  collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had 
      passed  he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what 
      motives his cousin could refuse him  and though his pride was 
      hurt  he suffered in no other way  his regard for her was quite 
      imaginary  and the possibility of her deserving her mother   s 
      reproach prevented his feeling any regret  
 
      while the family were in this confusion  charlotte lucas came to 
      spend the day with them  she was met in the vestibule by lydia  
      who  flying to her  cried in a half whisper     i am glad you are 
      come  for there is such fun here  what do you think has happened 
      this morning  mr  collins has made an offer to lizzy  and she 
      will not have him     
 
      charlotte hardly had time to answer  before they were joined by 
      kitty  who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they 
      entered the breakfast-room  where mrs  bennet was alone  than she 
      likewise began on the subject  calling on miss lucas for her 
      compassion  and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to 
      comply with the wishes of all her family     pray do  my dear miss 
      lucas     she added in a melancholy tone     for nobody is on my 
      side  nobody takes part with me  i am cruelly used  nobody feels 
      for my poor nerves     
 
      charlotte   s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and 
      elizabeth  
 
         aye  there she comes     continued mrs  bennet     looking as 
      unconcerned as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were 
      at york  provided she can have her own way  but i tell you  miss 
      lizzy   if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer 
      of marriage in this way  you will never get a husband at all   and 
      i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father 
      is dead   i  shall not be able to keep you   and so i warn you  i 
      have done with you from this very day  i told you in the library  
      you know  that i should never speak to you again  and you will 
      find me as good as my word  i have no pleasure in talking to 
      undutiful children  not that i have much pleasure  indeed  in 
      talking to anybody  people who suffer as i do from nervous 
      complaints can have no great inclination for talking  nobody can 
      tell what i suffer  but it is always so  those who do not 
      complain are never pitied     
 
      her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that 
      any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase 
      the irritation  she talked on  therefore  without interruption 
      from any of them  till they were joined by mr  collins  who 
      entered the room with an air more stately than usual  and on 
      perceiving whom  she said to the girls     now  i do insist upon 
      it  that you  all of you  hold your tongues  and let me and mr  
      collins have a little conversation together     
 
      elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  jane and kitty 
      followed  but lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she 
      could  and charlotte  detained first by the civility of mr  
      collins  whose enquiries after herself and all her family were 
      very minute  and then by a little curiosity  satisfied herself 
      with walking to the window and pretending not to hear  in a 
      doleful voice mrs  bennet began the projected conversation     oh  
      mr  collins     
 
         my dear madam     replied he     let us be for ever silent on this 
      point  far be it from me     he presently continued  in a voice 
      that marked his displeasure     to resent the behaviour of your 
      daughter  resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all  
      the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i 
      have been in early preferment  and i trust i am resigned  perhaps 
      not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had 
      my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  for i have often 
      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the 
      blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our 
      estimation  you will not  i hope  consider me as showing any 
      disrespect to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my 
      pretensions to your daughter   s favour  without having paid 
      yourself and mr  bennet the compliment of requesting you to 
      interpose your authority in my behalf  my conduct may  i fear  be 
      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your 
      daughter   s lips instead of your own  but we are all liable to 
      error  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair  my 
      object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with 
      due consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my 
       manner  has been at all reprehensible  i here beg leave to 
      apologise     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 21 
 
      the discussion of mr  collins   s offer was now nearly at an end  
      and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings 
      necessarily attending it  and occasionally from some peevish 
      allusions of her mother  as for the gentleman himself   his  
      feelings were chiefly expressed  not by embarrassment or 
      dejection  or by trying to avoid her  but by stiffness of manner 
      and resentful silence  he scarcely ever spoke to her  and the 
      assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself 
      were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas  whose 
      civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all  
      and especially to her friend  
 
      the morrow produced no abatement of mrs  bennet   s ill-humour or 
      ill health  mr  collins was also in the same state of angry 
      pride  elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his 
      visit  but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it  
      he was always to have gone on saturday  and to saturday he meant 
      to stay  
 
      after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to enquire if mr  
      wickham were returned  and to lament over his absence from the 
      netherfield ball  he joined them on their entering the town  and 
      attended them to their aunt   s where his regret and vexation  and 
      the concern of everybody  was well talked over  to elizabeth  
      however  he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his 
      absence  had  been self-imposed  
 
         i found     said he     as the time drew near that i had better not 
      meet mr  darcy  that to be in the same room  the same party with 
      him for so many hours together  might be more than i could bear  
      and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself     
 
      she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a 
      full discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they 
      civilly bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer 
      walked back with them to longbourn  and during the walk he 
      particularly attended to her  his accompanying them was a double 
      advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and 
      it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her 
      father and mother  
 
      soon after their return  a letter was delivered to miss bennet  
      it came from netherfield  the envelope contained a sheet of 
      elegant  little  hot-pressed paper  well covered with a lady   s 
      fair  flowing hand  and elizabeth saw her sister   s countenance 
      change as she read it  and saw her dwelling intently on some 
      particular passages  jane recollected herself soon  and putting 
      the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the 
      general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the 
      subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no 
      sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from 
      jane invited her to follow her up stairs  when they had gained 
      their own room  jane  taking out the letter  said  
 
         this is from caroline bingley  what it contains has surprised me 
      a good deal  the whole party have left netherfield by this time  
      and are on their way to town   and without any intention of coming 
      back again  you shall hear what she says     
 
      she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the 
      information of their having just resolved to follow their brother 
      to town directly  and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor 
      street  where mr  hurst had a house  the next was in these words  
         i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in 
      hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  but we 
      will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that 
      delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may 
      lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most 
      unreserved correspondence  i depend on you for that     to these 
      highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the 
      insensibility of distrust  and though the suddenness of their 
      removal surprised her  she saw nothing in it really to lament  it 
      was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would 
      prevent mr  bingley   s being there  and as to the loss of their 
      society  she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it  in 
      the enjoyment of his  
 
         it is unlucky     said she  after a short pause     that you should 
      not be able to see your friends before they leave the country  
      but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which 
      miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware  
      and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends 
      will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters  mr  
      bingley will not be detained in london by them     
 
         caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into 
      hertfordshire this winter  i will read it to you     
 
         when my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business 
      which took him to london might be concluded in three or four 
      days  but as we are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time 
      convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry 
      to leave it again  we have determined on following him thither  
      that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a 
      comfortless hotel  many of my acquaintances are already there for 
      the winter  i wish that i could hear that you  my dearest friend  
      had any intention of making one of the crowd   but of that i 
      despair  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may 
      abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and 
      that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling 
      the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you     
 
         it is evident by this     added jane     that he comes back no more 
      this winter     
 
         it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he 
       should      
 
         why will you think so  it must be his own doing  he is his own 
      master  but you do not know  all   i  will  read you the passage 
      which particularly hurts me  i will have no reserves from  you      
 
         mr  darcy is impatient to see his sister  and  to confess the 
      truth   we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again  i really 
      do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  
      and accomplishments  and the affection she inspires in louisa and 
      myself is heightened into something still more interesting  from 
      the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister  i 
      do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on 
      this subject  but i will not leave the country without confiding 
      them  and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable  my 
      brother admires her greatly already  he will have frequent 
      opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing  her 
      relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a 
      sister   s partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call 
      charles most capable of engaging any woman   s heart  with all 
      these circumstances to favour an attachment  and nothing to 
      prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest jane  in indulging the hope of 
      an event which will secure the happiness of so many     
 
         what do you think of  this  sentence  my dear lizzy     said jane 
      as she finished it     is it not clear enough  does it not 
      expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to 
      be her sister  that she is perfectly convinced of her brother   s 
      indifference  and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings 
      for him  she means  most kindly   to put me on my guard  can 
      there be any other opinion on the subject     
 
         yes  there can  for mine is totally different  will you hear 
      it     
 
         most willingly     
 
         you shall have it in a few words  miss bingley sees that her 
      brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry miss darcy  
      she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries 
      to persuade you that he does not care about you     
 
      jane shook her head  
 
         indeed  jane  you ought to believe me  no one who has ever seen 
      you together can doubt his affection  miss bingley  i am sure  
      cannot  she is not such a simpleton  could she have seen half as 
      much love in mr  darcy for herself  she would have ordered her 
      wedding clothes  but the case is this  we are not rich enough or 
      grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get miss 
      darcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been 
       one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a 
      second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and i dare 
      say it would succeed  if miss de bourgh were out of the way  but  
      my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss 
      bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy  he is 
      in the smallest degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he 
      took leave of you on tuesday  or that it will be in her power to 
      persuade him that  instead of being in love with you  he is very 
      much in love with her friend     
 
         if we thought alike of miss bingley     replied jane     your 
      representation of all this might make me quite easy  but i know 
      the foundation is unjust  caroline is incapable of wilfully 
      deceiving anyone  and all that i can hope in this case is that 
      she is deceiving herself     
 
         that is right  you could not have started a more happy idea  
      since you will not take comfort in mine  believe her to be 
      deceived  by all means  you have now done your duty by her  and 
      must fret no longer     
 
         but  my dear sister  can i be happy  even supposing the best  in 
      accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to 
      marry elsewhere     
 
         you must decide for yourself     said elizabeth     and if  upon 
      mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his 
      two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his 
      wife  i advise you by all means to refuse him     
 
         how can you talk so     said jane  faintly smiling     you must know 
      that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their 
      disapprobation  i could not hesitate     
 
         i did not think you would  and that being the case  i cannot 
      consider your situation with much compassion     
 
         but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be 
      required  a thousand things may arise in six months     
 
      the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the 
      utmost contempt  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of 
      caroline   s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment 
      suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken  
      could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone  
 
      she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she 
      felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its 
      happy effect  jane   s temper was not desponding  and she was 
      gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection 
      sometimes overcame the hope  that bingley would return to 
      netherfield and answer every wish of her heart  
 
      they agreed that mrs  bennet should only hear of the departure of 
      the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman   s 
      conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great 
      deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that 
      the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting 
      so intimate together  after lamenting it  however  at some 
      length  she had the consolation that mr  bingley would be soon 
      down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the conclusion of 
      all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had been 
      invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two 
      full courses  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 22 
 
      the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again 
      during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen 
      to mr  collins  elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her  
         it keeps him in good humour     said she     and i am more obliged 
      to you than i can express     charlotte assured her friend of her 
      satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for 
      the little sacrifice of her time  this was very amiable  but 
      charlotte   s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any 
      conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her 
      from any return of mr  collins   s addresses  by engaging them 
      towards herself  such was miss lucas   s scheme  and appearances 
      were so favourable  that when they parted at night  she would 
      have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave 
      hertfordshire so very soon  but here she did injustice to the 
      fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape 
      out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness  
      and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet  he was 
      anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  from a conviction 
      that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to conjecture 
      his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till 
      its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost 
      secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably 
      encouraging  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure 
      of wednesday  his reception  however  was of the most flattering 
      kind  miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked 
      towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally 
      in the lane  but little had she dared to hope that so much love 
      and eloquence awaited her there  
 
      in as short a time as mr  collins   s long speeches would allow  
      everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  
      and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name 
      the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such 
      a solicitation must be waived for the present  the lady felt no 
      inclination to trifle with his happiness  the stupidity with 
      which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any 
      charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and miss 
      lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested 
      desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment 
      were gained  
 
      sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their 
      consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity  mr  
      collins   s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for 
      their daughter  to whom they could give little fortune  and his 
      prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair  lady lucas 
      began directly to calculate  with more interest than the matter 
      had ever excited before  how many years longer mr  bennet was 
      likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion  
      that whenever mr  collins should be in possession of the 
      longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and 
      his wife should make their appearance at st  james   s  the whole 
      family  in short  were properly overjoyed on the occasion  the 
      younger girls formed hopes of  coming out  a year or two sooner 
      than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved 
      from their apprehension of charlotte   s dying an old maid  
      charlotte herself was tolerably composed  she had gained her 
      point  and had time to consider of it  her reflections were in 
      general satisfactory  mr  collins  to be sure  was neither 
      sensible nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his 
      attachment to her must be imaginary  but still he would be her 
      husband  without thinking highly either of men or matrimony  
      marriage had always been her object  it was the only provision 
      for well-educated young women of small fortune  and however 
      uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest 
      preservative from want  this preservative she had now obtained  
      and at the age of twenty-seven  without having ever been 
      handsome  she felt all the good luck of it  the least agreeable 
      circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to 
      elizabeth bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any 
      other person  elizabeth would wonder  and probably would blame 
      her  and though her resolution was not to be shaken  her feelings 
      must be hurt by such a disapprobation  she resolved to give her 
      the information herself  and therefore charged mr  collins  when 
      he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had 
      passed before any of the family  a promise of secrecy was of 
      course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without 
      difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst 
      forth in such very direct questions on his return as required 
      some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising 
      great self-denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous 
      love  
 
      as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any 
      of the family  the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when 
      the ladies moved for the night  and mrs  bennet  with great 
      politeness and cordiality  said how happy they should be to see 
      him at longbourn again  whenever his engagements might allow him 
      to visit them  
 
         my dear madam     he replied     this invitation is particularly 
      gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and 
      you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon 
      as possible     
 
      they were all astonished  and mr  bennet  who could by no means 
      wish for so speedy a return  immediately said  
 
         but is there not danger of lady catherine   s disapprobation here  
      my good sir  you had better neglect your relations than run the 
      risk of offending your patroness     
 
         my dear sir     replied mr  collins     i am particularly obliged to 
      you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not 
      taking so material a step without her ladyship   s concurrence     
 
         you cannot be too much upon your guard  risk anything rather 
      than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by 
      your coming to us again  which i should think exceedingly 
      probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that  we  shall 
      take no offence     
 
         believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such 
      affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily 
      receive from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other 
      mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire  as for my 
      fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render 
      it necessary  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health 
      and happiness  not excepting my cousin elizabeth     
 
      with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them 
      equally surprised that he meditated a quick return  mrs  bennet 
      wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his 
      addresses to one of her younger girls  and mary might have been 
      prevailed on to accept him  she rated his abilities much higher 
      than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections 
      which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as 
      herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve 
      himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very 
      agreeable companion  but on the following morning  every hope of 
      this kind was done away  miss lucas called soon after breakfast  
      and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of 
      the day before  
 
      the possibility of mr  collins   s fancying himself in love with 
      her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or 
      two  but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far 
      from possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her 
      astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first 
      the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out  
 
         engaged to mr  collins  my dear charlotte   impossible     
 
      the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling 
      her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so 
      direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected  
      she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied  
 
         why should you be surprised  my dear eliza  do you think it 
      incredible that mr  collins should be able to procure any woman   s 
      good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with 
      you     
 
      but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong 
      effort for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that 
      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her  
      and that she wished her all imaginable happiness  
 
         i see what you are feeling     replied charlotte     you must be 
      surprised  very much surprised   so lately as mr  collins was 
      wishing to marry you  but when you have had time to think it 
      over  i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done  i am 
      not romantic  you know  i never was  i ask only a comfortable 
      home  and considering mr  collins   s character  connection  and 
      situation in life  i am convinced that my chance of happiness 
      with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the 
      marriage state     
 
      elizabeth quietly answered    undoubtedly     and after an awkward 
      pause  they returned to the rest of the family  charlotte did not 
      stay much longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what 
      she had heard  it was a long time before she became at all 
      reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match  the strangeness 
      of mr  collins   s making two offers of marriage within three days 
      was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted  she had 
      always felt that charlotte   s opinion of matrimony was not exactly 
      like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible that  
      when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better 
      feeling to worldly advantage  charlotte the wife of mr  collins 
      was a most humiliating picture  and to the pang of a friend 
      disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the 
      distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to 
      be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 23 
 
      elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on 
      what she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to 
      mention it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his 
      daughter  to announce her engagement to the family  with many 
      compliments to them  and much self-gratulation on the prospect of 
      a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter   to an 
      audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for mrs  bennet  
      with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be 
      entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil  
      boisterously exclaimed  
 
         good lord  sir william  how can you tell such a story  do not 
      you know that mr  collins wants to marry lizzy     
 
      nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne 
      without anger such treatment  but sir william   s good breeding 
      carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be 
      positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all 
      their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy  
 
      elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so 
      unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his 
      account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte 
      herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her 
      mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to 
      sir william  in which she was readily joined by jane  and by 
      making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be 
      expected from the match  the excellent character of mr  collins  
      and the convenient distance of hunsford from london  
 
      mrs  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal 
      while sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than 
      her feelings found a rapid vent  in the first place  she 
      persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter  secondly  she 
      was very sure that mr  collins had been taken in  thirdly  she 
      trusted that they would never be happy together  and fourthly  
      that the match might be broken off  two inferences  however  were 
      plainly deduced from the whole  one  that elizabeth was the real 
      cause of the mischief  and the other that she herself had been 
      barbarously misused by them all  and on these two points she 
      principally dwelt during the rest of the day  nothing could 
      console and nothing could appease her  nor did that day wear out 
      her resentment  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth 
      without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak 
      to sir william or lady lucas without being rude  and many months 
      were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter  
 
      mr  bennet   s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion  
      and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most 
      agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that 
      charlotte lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably 
      sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his 
      daughter  
 
      jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she 
      said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for 
      their happiness  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it 
      as improbable  kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas  
      for mr  collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no 
      other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton  
 
      lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to 
      retort on mrs  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well 
      married  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to 
      say how happy she was  though mrs  bennet   s sour looks and 
      ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness 
      away  
 
      between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept 
      them mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded 
      that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again  
      her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard 
      to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her 
      opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew 
      daily more anxious  as bingley had now been gone a week and 
      nothing more was heard of his return  
 
      jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was 
      counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again  
      the promised letter of thanks from mr  collins arrived on 
      tuesday  addressed to their father  and written with all the 
      solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth   s abode in the family 
      might have prompted  after discharging his conscience on that 
      head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous 
      expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of 
      their amiable neighbour  miss lucas  and then explained that it 
      was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been 
      so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at 
      longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday 
      fortnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his 
      marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible  
      which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his 
      amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the 
      happiest of men  
 
      mr  collins   s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of 
      pleasure to mrs  bennet  on the contrary  she was as much 
      disposed to complain of it as her husband  it was very strange 
      that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it 
      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome  she hated 
      having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent  
      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable  such were 
      the gentle murmurs of mrs  bennet  and they gave way only to the 
      greater distress of mr  bingley   s continued absence  
 
      neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject  day 
      after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him 
      than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming 
      no more to netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly 
      incensed mrs  bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as 
      a most scandalous falsehood  
 
      even elizabeth began to fear   not that bingley was indifferent   but 
      that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away  
      unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane   s 
      happiness  and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she 
      could not prevent its frequently occurring  the united efforts of 
      his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend  
      assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of 
      london might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his 
      attachment  
 
      as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspense was  of course  
      more painful than elizabeth   s  but whatever she felt she was 
      desirous of concealing  and between herself and elizabeth  
      therefore  the subject was never alluded to  but as no such 
      delicacy restrained her mother  an hour seldom passed in which 
      she did not talk of bingley  express her impatience for his 
      arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he did not come 
      back she would think herself very ill used  it needed all jane   s 
      steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable 
      tranquillity  
 
      mr  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight  but his 
      reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been 
      on his first introduction  he was too happy  however  to need 
      much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of 
      love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company  the 
      chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge  and he 
      sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology 
      for his absence before the family went to bed  
 
      mrs  bennet was really in a most pitiable state  the very mention 
      of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of 
      ill-humour  and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it 
      talked of  the sight of miss lucas was odious to her  as her 
      successor in that house  she regarded her with jealous 
      abhorrence  whenever charlotte came to see them  she concluded 
      her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and whenever she 
      spoke in a low voice to mr  collins  was convinced that they were 
      talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself 
      and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr  bennet were 
      dead  she complained bitterly of all this to her husband  
 
         indeed  mr  bennet     said she     it is very hard to think that 
      charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that  i  
      should be forced to make way for  her   and live to see her take 
      her place in it     
 
         my dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  let us hope 
      for better things  let us flatter ourselves that  i  may be the 
      survivor     
 
      this was not very consoling to mrs  bennet  and therefore  
      instead of making any answer  she went on as before  
 
         i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  if 
      it was not for the entail  i should not mind it     
 
         what should not you mind     
 
         i should not mind anything at all     
 
         let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such 
      insensibility     
 
         i never can be thankful  mr  bennet  for anything about the 
      entail  how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an 
      estate from one   s own daughters  i cannot understand  and all for 
      the sake of mr  collins too  why should  he  have it more than 
      anybody else     
 
         i leave it to yourself to determine     said mr  bennet  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 24 
 
      miss bingley   s letter arrived  and put an end to doubt  the very 
      first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled 
      in london for the winter  and concluded with her brother   s regret 
      at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in 
      hertfordshire before he left the country  
 
      hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the 
      rest of the letter  she found little  except the professed 
      affection of the writer  that could give her any comfort  miss 
      darcy   s praise occupied the chief of it  her many attractions 
      were again dwelt on  and caroline boasted joyfully of their 
      increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict the accomplishment 
      of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter  she 
      wrote also with great pleasure of her brother   s being an inmate 
      of mr  darcy   s house  and mentioned with raptures some plans of 
      the latter with regard to new furniture  
 
      elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all 
      this  heard it in silent indignation  her heart was divided 
      between concern for her sister  and resentment against all 
      others  to caroline   s assertion of her brother   s being partial to 
      miss darcy she paid no credit  that he was really fond of jane  
      she doubted no more than she had ever done  and much as she had 
      always been disposed to like him  she could not think without 
      anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness of temper  that 
      want of proper resolution  which now made him the slave of his 
      designing friends  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness 
      to the caprice of their inclination  had his own happiness  
      however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to 
      sport with it in whatever manner he thought best  but her 
      sister   s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible 
      himself  it was a subject  in short  on which reflection would be 
      long indulged  and must be unavailing  she could think of nothing 
      else  and yet whether bingley   s regard had really died away  or 
      were suppressed by his friends    interference  whether he had been 
      aware of jane   s attachment  or whether it had escaped his 
      observation  whatever were the case  though her opinion of him 
      must be materially affected by the difference  her sister   s 
      situation remained the same  her peace equally wounded  
 
      a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her 
      feelings to elizabeth  but at last  on mrs  bennet   s leaving them 
      together  after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield 
      and its master  she could not help saying  
 
         oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can 
      have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual 
      reflections on him  but i will not repine  it cannot last long  
      he will be forgot  and we shall all be as we were before     
 
      elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but 
      said nothing  
 
         you doubt me     cried jane  slightly colouring     indeed  you have 
      no reason  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my 
      acquaintance  but that is all  i have nothing either to hope or 
      fear  and nothing to reproach him with  thank god  i have not 
       that  pain  a little time  therefore   i shall certainly try to 
      get the better     
 
      with a stronger voice she soon added     i have this comfort 
      immediately  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on 
      my side  and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself     
 
         my dear jane     exclaimed elizabeth     you are too good  your 
      sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic  i do not know 
      what to say to you  i feel as if i had never done you justice  or 
      loved you as you deserve     
 
      miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw 
      back the praise on her sister   s warm affection  
 
         nay     said elizabeth     this is not fair   you  wish to think all 
      the world respectable  and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody  
       i  only want to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself 
      against it  do not be afraid of my running into any excess  of my 
      encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will  you need 
      not  there are few people whom i really love  and still fewer of 
      whom i think well  the more i see of the world  the more am i 
      dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms my belief of the 
      inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little 
      dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or 
      sense  i have met with two instances lately  one i will not 
      mention  the other is charlotte   s marriage  it is unaccountable  
      in every view it is unaccountable     
 
         my dear lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  they 
      will ruin your happiness  you do not make allowance enough for 
      difference of situation and temper  consider mr  collins   s 
      respectability  and charlotte   s steady  prudent character  
      remember that she is one of a large family  that as to fortune  
      it is a most eligible match  and be ready to believe  for 
      everybody   s sake  that she may feel something like regard and 
      esteem for our cousin     
 
         to oblige you  i would try to believe almost anything  but no 
      one else could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were i 
      persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him  i should only 
      think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart  my 
      dear jane  mr  collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow-minded  
      silly man  you know he is  as well as i do  and you must feel  as 
      well as i do  that the woman who married him cannot have a proper 
      way of thinking  you shall not defend her  though it is charlotte 
      lucas  you shall not  for the sake of one individual  change the 
      meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade 
      yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility 
      of danger security for happiness     
 
         i must think your language too strong in speaking of both     
      replied jane     and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing 
      them happy together  but enough of this  you alluded to something 
      else  you mentioned  two  instances  i cannot misunderstand you  
      but i entreat you  dear lizzy  not to pain me by thinking  that 
      person  to blame  and saying your opinion of him is sunk  we must 
      not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured  we must 
      not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and 
      circumspect  it is very often nothing but our own vanity that 
      deceives us  women fancy admiration means more than it does     
 
         and men take care that they should     
 
         if it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but i have 
      no idea of there being so much design in the world as some 
      persons imagine     
 
         i am far from attributing any part of mr  bingley   s conduct to 
      design     said elizabeth     but without scheming to do wrong  or to 
      make others unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery  
      thoughtlessness  want of attention to other people   s feelings  
      and want of resolution  will do the business     
 
         and do you impute it to either of those     
 
         yes  to the last  but if i go on  i shall displease you by 
      saying what i think of persons you esteem  stop me whilst you 
      can     
 
         you persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him     
 
         yes  in conjunction with his friend     
 
         i cannot believe it  why should they try to influence him  they 
      can only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no 
      other woman can secure it     
 
         your first position is false  they may wish many things besides 
      his happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and 
      consequence  they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the 
      importance of money  great connections  and pride     
 
         beyond a doubt  they do wish him to choose miss darcy     replied 
      jane     but this may be from better feelings than you are 
      supposing  they have known her much longer than they have known 
      me  no wonder if they love her better  but  whatever may be their 
      own wishes  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their 
      brother   s  what sister would think herself at liberty to do it  
      unless there were something very objectionable  if they believed 
      him attached to me  they would not try to part us  if he were so  
      they could not succeed  by supposing such an affection  you make 
      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most unhappy  do 
      not distress me by the idea  i am not ashamed of having been 
      mistaken   or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison 
      of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  let 
      me take it in the best light  in the light in which it may be 
      understood     
 
      elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time mr  
      bingley   s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them  
 
      mrs  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning 
      no more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did 
      not account for it clearly  there was little chance of her ever 
      considering it with less perplexity  her daughter endeavoured to 
      convince her of what she did not believe herself  that his 
      attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and 
      transient liking  which ceased when he saw her no more  but 
      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time  
      she had the same story to repeat every day  mrs  bennet   s best 
      comfort was that mr  bingley must be down again in the summer  
 
      mr  bennet treated the matter differently     so  lizzy     said he 
      one day     your sister is crossed in love  i find  i congratulate 
      her  next to being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little 
      in love now and then  it is something to think of  and it gives 
      her a sort of distinction among her companions  when is your turn 
      to come  you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane  now is 
      your time  here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all 
      the young ladies in the country  let wickham be your man  he is a 
      pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably     
 
         thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  we 
      must not all expect jane   s good fortune     
 
         true     said mr  bennet     but it is a comfort to think that 
      whatever of that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate 
      mother who will make the most of it     
 
      mr  wickham   s society was of material service in dispelling the 
      gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of 
      the longbourn family  they saw him often  and to his other 
      recommendations was now added that of general unreserve  the 
      whole of what elizabeth had already heard  his claims on mr  
      darcy  and all that he had suffered from him  was now openly 
      acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and everybody was pleased to 
      know how much they had always disliked mr  darcy before they had 
      known anything of the matter  
 
      miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might 
      be any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the 
      society of hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always 
      pleaded for allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes   but 
      by everybody else mr  darcy was condemned as the worst of men  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 25 
 
      after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of 
      felicity  mr  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by 
      the arrival of saturday  the pain of separation  however  might 
      be alleviated on his side  by preparations for the reception of 
      his bride  as he had reason to hope  that shortly after his 
      return into hertfordshire  the day would be fixed that was to 
      make him the happiest of men  he took leave of his relations at 
      longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair 
      cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father 
      another letter of thanks  
 
      on the following monday  mrs  bennet had the pleasure of 
      receiving her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend 
      the christmas at longbourn  mr  gardiner was a sensible  
      gentlemanlike man  greatly superior to his sister  as well by 
      nature as education  the netherfield ladies would have had 
      difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade  and within 
      view of his own warehouses  could have been so well-bred and 
      agreeable  mrs  gardiner  who was several years younger than mrs  
      bennet and mrs  phillips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant 
      woman  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces  
      between the two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a 
      particular regard  they had frequently been staying with her in 
      town  
 
      the first part of mrs  gardiner   s business on her arrival was to 
      distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  when 
      this was done she had a less active part to play  it became her 
      turn to listen  mrs  bennet had many grievances to relate  and 
      much to complain of  they had all been very ill-used since she 
      last saw her sister  two of her girls had been upon the point of 
      marriage  and after all there was nothing in it  
 
         i do not blame jane     she continued     for jane would have got 
      mr  bingley if she could  but lizzy  oh  sister  it is very hard 
      to think that she might have been mr  collins   s wife by this 
      time  had it not been for her own perverseness  he made her an 
      offer in this very room  and she refused him  the consequence of 
      it is  that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i 
      have  and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as 
      ever  the lucases are very artful people indeed  sister  they are 
      all for what they can get  i am sorry to say it of them  but so 
      it is  it makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted so in 
      my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves 
      before anybody else  however  your coming just at this time is 
      the greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you 
      tell us  of long sleeves     
 
      mrs  gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given 
      before  in the course of jane and elizabeth   s correspondence with 
      her  made her sister a slight answer  and  in compassion to her 
      nieces  turned the conversation  
 
      when alone with elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the 
      subject     it seems likely to have been a desirable match for 
      jane     said she     i am sorry it went off  but these things happen 
      so often  a young man  such as you describe mr  bingley  so 
      easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks  and when 
      accident separates them  so easily forgets her  that these sort 
      of inconsistencies are very frequent     
 
         an excellent consolation in its way     said elizabeth     but it 
      will not do for  us   we do not suffer by accident  it does not 
      often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a 
      young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom 
      he was violently in love with only a few days before     
 
         but that expression of    violently in love    is so hackneyed  so 
      doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  it is 
      as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour   s 
      acquaintance  as to a real  strong attachment  pray  how  violent 
      was  mr  bingley   s love     
 
         i never saw a more promising inclination  he was growing quite 
      inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  every 
      time they met  it was more decided and remarkable  at his own 
      ball he offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to 
      dance  and i spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an 
      answer  could there be finer symptoms  is not general incivility 
      the very essence of love     
 
         oh  yes    of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt  
      poor jane  i am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she 
      may not get over it immediately  it had better have happened to 
       you   lizzy  you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner  
      but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us  
      change of scene might be of service   and perhaps a little relief 
      from home may be as useful as anything     
 
      elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt 
      persuaded of her sister   s ready acquiescence  
 
         i hope     added mrs  gardiner     that no consideration with regard 
      to this young man will influence her  we live in so different a 
      part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you 
      well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable that 
      they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her     
 
         and  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of 
      his friend  and mr  darcy would no more suffer him to call on 
      jane in such a part of london  my dear aunt  how could you think 
      of it  mr  darcy may perhaps have  heard  of such a place as 
      gracechurch street  but he would hardly think a month   s ablution 
      enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter 
      it  and depend upon it  mr  bingley never stirs without him     
 
         so much the better  i hope they will not meet at all  but does 
      not jane correspond with his sister   she  will not be able to 
      help calling     
 
         she will drop the acquaintance entirely     
 
      but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to 
      place this point  as well as the still more interesting one of 
      bingley   s being withheld from seeing jane  she felt a solicitude 
      on the subject which convinced her  on examination  that she did 
      not consider it entirely hopeless  it was possible  and sometimes 
      she thought it probable  that his affection might be reanimated  
      and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the 
      more natural influence of jane   s attractions  
 
      miss bennet accepted her aunt   s invitation with pleasure  and the 
      bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than 
      as she hoped by caroline   s not living in the same house with her 
      brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without 
      any danger of seeing him  
 
      the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn  and what with the 
      phillipses  the lucases  and the officers  there was not a day 
      without its engagement  mrs  bennet had so carefully provided for 
      the entertainment of her brother and sister  that they did not 
      once sit down to a family dinner  when the engagement was for 
      home  some of the officers always made part of it   of which 
      officers mr  wickham was sure to be one  and on these occasions  
      mrs  gardiner  rendered suspicious by elizabeth   s warm 
      commendation  narrowly observed them both  without supposing 
      them  from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their 
      preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little 
      uneasy  and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject 
      before she left hertfordshire  and represent to her the 
      imprudence of encouraging such an attachment  
 
      to mrs  gardiner  wickham had one means of affording pleasure  
      unconnected with his general powers  about ten or a dozen years 
      ago  before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in 
      that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged  they had  
      therefore  many acquaintances in common  and though wickham had 
      been little there since the death of darcy   s father  it was yet 
      in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former 
      friends than she had been in the way of procuring  
 
      mrs  gardiner had seen pemberley  and known the late mr  darcy by 
      character perfectly well  here consequently was an inexhaustible 
      subject of discourse  in comparing her recollection of pemberley 
      with the minute description which wickham could give  and in 
      bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late 
      possessor  she was delighting both him and herself  on being made 
      acquainted with the present mr  darcy   s treatment of him  she 
      tried to remember some of that gentleman   s reputed disposition 
      when quite a lad which might agree with it  and was confident at 
      last that she recollected having heard mr  fitzwilliam darcy 
      formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill-natured boy  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 26 
 
      mrs  gardiner   s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly 
      given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her 
      alone  after honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went 
      on  
 
         you are too sensible a girl  lizzy  to fall in love merely 
      because you are warned against it  and  therefore  i am not 
      afraid of speaking openly  seriously  i would have you be on your 
      guard  do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an 
      affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent  
      i have nothing to say against  him   he is a most interesting 
      young man  and if he had the fortune he ought to have  i should 
      think you could not do better  but as it is  you must not let 
      your fancy run away with you  you have sense  and we all expect 
      you to use it  your father would depend on  your  resolution and 
      good conduct  i am sure  you must not disappoint your father     
 
         my dear aunt  this is being serious indeed     
 
         yes  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise     
 
         well  then  you need not be under any alarm  i will take care of 
      myself  and of mr  wickham too  he shall not be in love with me  
      if i can prevent it     
 
         elizabeth  you are not serious now     
 
         i beg your pardon  i will try again  at present i am not in love 
      with mr  wickham  no  i certainly am not  but he is  beyond all 
      comparison  the most agreeable man i ever saw   and if he becomes 
      really attached to me   i believe it will be better that he should 
      not  i see the imprudence of it  oh   that  abominable mr  darcy  
      my father   s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  and i 
      should be miserable to forfeit it  my father  however  is partial 
      to mr  wickham  in short  my dear aunt  i should be very sorry to 
      be the means of making any of you unhappy  but since we see every 
      day that where there is affection  young people are seldom 
      withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into 
      engagements with each other  how can i promise to be wiser than 
      so many of my fellow-creatures if i am tempted  or how am i even 
      to know that it would be wisdom to resist  all that i can promise 
      you  therefore  is not to be in a hurry  i will not be in a hurry 
      to believe myself his first object  when i am in company with 
      him  i will not be wishing  in short  i will do my best     
 
         perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so 
      very often  at least  you should not  remind  your mother of 
      inviting him     
 
         as i did the other day     said elizabeth with a conscious smile  
         very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that   but do 
      not imagine that he is always here so often  it is on your 
      account that he has been so frequently invited this week  you 
      know my mother   s ideas as to the necessity of constant company 
      for her friends  but really  and upon my honour  i will try to do 
      what i think to be the wisest  and now i hope you are satisfied     
 
      her aunt assured her that she was  and elizabeth having thanked 
      her for the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful 
      instance of advice being given on such a point  without being 
      resented  
 
      mr  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been 
      quitted by the gardiners and jane  but as he took up his abode 
      with the lucases  his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs  
      bennet  his marriage was now fast approaching  and she was at 
      length so far resigned as to think it inevitable  and even 
      repeatedly to say  in an ill-natured tone  that she     wished  
      they might be happy     thursday was to be the wedding day  and on 
      wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit  and when she rose 
      to take leave  elizabeth  ashamed of her mother   s ungracious and 
      reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself  
      accompanied her out of the room  as they went downstairs 
      together  charlotte said  
 
         i shall depend on hearing from you very often  eliza     
 
          that  you certainly shall     
 
         and i have another favour to ask you  will you come and see me     
 
         we shall often meet  i hope  in hertfordshire     
 
         i am not likely to leave kent for some time  promise me  
      therefore  to come to hunsford     
 
      elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in 
      the visit  
 
         my father and maria are coming to me in march     added charlotte  
         and i hope you will consent to be of the party  indeed  eliza  
      you will be as welcome as either of them     
 
      the wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent 
      from the church door  and everybody had as much to say  or to 
      hear  on the subject as usual  elizabeth soon heard from her 
      friend  and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as 
      it had ever been  that it should be equally unreserved was 
      impossible  elizabeth could never address her without feeling 
      that all the comfort of intimacy was over  and though determined 
      not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the sake of what 
      had been  rather than what was  charlotte   s first letters were 
      received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be 
      curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she 
      would like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce 
      herself to be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt 
      that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she 
      might have foreseen  she wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with 
      comforts  and mentioned nothing which she could not praise  the 
      house  furniture  neighbourhood  and roads  were all to her 
      taste  and lady catherine   s behaviour was most friendly and 
      obliging  it was mr  collins   s picture of hunsford and rosings 
      rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait 
      for her own visit there to know the rest  
 
      jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce 
      their safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth 
      hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys  
 
      her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as 
      impatience generally is  jane had been a week in town without 
      either seeing or hearing from caroline  she accounted for it  
      however  by supposing that her last letter to her friend from 
      longbourn had by some accident been lost  
 
         my aunt     she continued     is going to-morrow into that part of 
      the town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in 
      grosvenor street     
 
      she wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen miss 
      bingley     i did not think caroline in spirits     were her words  
         but she was very glad to see me  and reproached me for giving 
      her no notice of my coming to london  i was right  therefore  my 
      last letter had never reached her  i enquired after their 
      brother  of course  he was well  but so much engaged with mr  
      darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  i found that miss darcy 
      was expected to dinner  i wish i could see her  my visit was not 
      long  as caroline and mrs  hurst were going out  i dare say i 
      shall see them soon here     
 
      elizabeth shook her head over this letter  it convinced her that 
      accident only could discover to mr  bingley her sister   s being in 
      town  
 
      four weeks passed away  and jane saw nothing of him  she 
      endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it  but 
      she could no longer be blind to miss bingley   s inattention  after 
      waiting at home every morning for a fortnight  and inventing 
      every evening a fresh excuse for her  the visitor did at last 
      appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more  the 
      alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no 
      longer  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister 
      will prove what she felt  
 
         my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in 
      her better judgement  at my expense  when i confess myself to 
      have been entirely deceived in miss bingley   s regard for me  but  
      my dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not 
      think me obstinate if i still assert that  considering what her 
      behaviour was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion  i 
      do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate 
      with me  but if the same circumstances were to happen again  i am 
      sure i should be deceived again  caroline did not return my visit 
      till yesterday  and not a note  not a line  did i receive in the 
      meantime  when she did come  it was very evident that she had no 
      pleasure in it  she made a slight  formal apology  for not 
      calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and 
      was in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went 
      away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no 
      longer  i pity  though i cannot help blaming her  she was very 
      wrong in singling me out as she did  i can safely say that every 
      advance to intimacy began on her side  but i pity her  because 
      she must feel that she has been acting wrong  and because i am 
      very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it  i need 
      not explain myself farther  and though  we  know this anxiety to 
      be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily account 
      for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to his 
      sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural 
      and amiable  i cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such 
      fears now  because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have 
      met  long ago  he knows of my being in town  i am certain  from 
      something she said herself  and yet it would seem  by her manner 
      of talking  as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is 
      really partial to miss darcy  i cannot understand it  if i were 
      not afraid of judging harshly  i should be almost tempted to say 
      that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this  but i 
      will endeavour to banish every painful thought  and think only of 
      what will make me happy   your affection  and the invariable 
      kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  let me hear from you very 
      soon  miss bingley said something of his never returning to 
      netherfield again  of giving up the house  but not with any 
      certainty  we had better not mention it  i am extremely glad that 
      you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford  
      pray go to see them  with sir william and maria  i am sure you 
      will be very comfortable there    yours  etc     
 
      this letter gave elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as 
      she considered that jane would no longer be duped  by the sister 
      at least  all expectation from the brother was now absolutely 
      over  she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions  
      his character sunk on every review of it  and as a punishment for 
      him  as well as a possible advantage to jane  she seriously hoped 
      he might really soon marry mr  darcy   s sister  as by wickham   s 
      account  she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown 
      away  
 
      mrs  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise 
      concerning that gentleman  and required information  and 
      elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to 
      her aunt than to herself  his apparent partiality had subsided  
      his attentions were over  he was the admirer of some one else  
      elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all  but she could see it 
      and write of it without material pain  her heart had been but 
      slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied with believing 
      that  she  would have been his only choice  had fortune permitted 
      it  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most 
      remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering 
      himself agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear-sighted perhaps in 
      this case than in charlotte   s  did not quarrel with him for his 
      wish of independence  nothing  on the contrary  could be more 
      natural  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few 
      struggles to relinquish her  she was ready to allow it a wise and 
      desirable measure for both  and could very sincerely wish him 
      happy  
 
      all this was acknowledged to mrs  gardiner  and after relating 
      the circumstances  she thus went on     i am now convinced  my dear 
      aunt  that i have never been much in love  for had i really 
      experienced that pure and elevating passion  i should at present 
      detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil  but my 
      feelings are not only cordial towards  him   they are even 
      impartial towards miss king  i cannot find out that i hate her at 
      all  or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good 
      sort of girl  there can be no love in all this  my watchfulness 
      has been effectual  and though i certainly should be a more 
      interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in 
      love with him  i cannot say that i regret my comparative 
      insignificance  importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly  
      kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do  
      they are young in the ways of the world  and not yet open to the 
      mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something 
      to live on as well as the plain     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 27 
 
      with no greater events than these in the longbourn family  and 
      otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton  
      sometimes dirty and sometimes cold  did january and february pass 
      away  march was to take elizabeth to hunsford  she had not at 
      first thought very seriously of going thither  but charlotte  she 
      soon found  was depending on the plan and she gradually learned 
      to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater 
      certainty  absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte 
      again  and weakened her disgust of mr  collins  there was novelty 
      in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such 
      uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little 
      change was not unwelcome for its own sake  the journey would 
      moreover give her a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew 
      near  she would have been very sorry for any delay  everything  
      however  went on smoothly  and was finally settled according to 
      charlotte   s first sketch  she was to accompany sir william and 
      his second daughter  the improvement of spending a night in 
      london was added in time  and the plan became perfect as plan 
      could be  
 
      the only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss 
      her  and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her 
      going  that he told her to write to him  and almost promised to 
      answer her letter  
 
      the farewell between herself and mr  wickham was perfectly 
      friendly  on his side even more  his present pursuit could not 
      make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and 
      to deserve his attention  the first to listen and to pity  the 
      first to be admired  and in his manner of bidding her adieu  
      wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of what she was to 
      expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their opinion of 
      her   their opinion of everybody   would always coincide  there was a 
      solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to 
      him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced 
      that  whether married or single  he must always be her model of 
      the amiable and pleasing  
 
      her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her 
      think him less agreeable  sir william lucas  and his daughter 
      maria  a good-humoured girl  but as empty-headed as himself  had 
      nothing to say that could be worth hearing  and were listened to 
      with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise  elizabeth 
      loved absurdities  but she had known sir william   s too long  he 
      could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and 
      knighthood  and his civilities were worn out  like his 
      information  
 
      it was a journey of only twenty-four miles  and they began it so 
      early as to be in gracechurch street by noon  as they drove to 
      mr  gardiner   s door  jane was at a drawing-room window watching 
      their arrival  when they entered the passage she was there to 
      welcome them  and elizabeth  looking earnestly in her face  was 
      pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever  on the stairs 
      were a troop of little boys and girls  whose eagerness for their 
      cousin   s appearance would not allow them to wait in the 
      drawing-room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen her for a 
      twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower  all was joy and 
      kindness  the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in 
      bustle and shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres  
 
      elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt  their first object 
      was her sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear  
      in reply to her minute enquiries  that though jane always 
      struggled to support her spirits  there were periods of 
      dejection  it was reasonable  however  to hope that they would 
      not continue long  mrs  gardiner gave her the particulars also of 
      miss bingley   s visit in gracechurch street  and repeated 
      conversations occurring at different times between jane and 
      herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given 
      up the acquaintance  
 
      mrs  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham   s desertion  and 
      complimented her on bearing it so well  
 
         but my dear elizabeth     she added     what sort of girl is miss 
      king  i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary     
 
         pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial 
      affairs  between the mercenary and the prudent motive  where does 
      discretion end  and avarice begin  last christmas you were afraid 
      of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent  and now  
      because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds  
      you want to find out that he is mercenary     
 
         if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is  i shall 
      know what to think     
 
         she is a very good kind of girl  i believe  i know no harm of 
      her     
 
         but he paid her not the smallest attention till her 
      grandfather   s death made her mistress of this fortune     
 
         no   why should he  if it were not allowable for him to gain  my  
      affections because i had no money  what occasion could there be 
      for making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was 
      equally poor     
 
         but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions 
      towards her so soon after this event     
 
         a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those 
      elegant decorums which other people may observe  if  she  does 
      not object to it  why should  we      
 
          her  not objecting does not justify  him   it only shows her 
      being deficient in something herself   sense or feeling     
 
         well     cried elizabeth     have it as you choose   he  shall be 
      mercenary  and  she  shall be foolish     
 
         no  lizzy  that is what i do  not  choose  i should be sorry  
      you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in 
      derbyshire     
 
         oh  if that is all  i have a very poor opinion of young men who 
      live in derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in 
      hertfordshire are not much better  i am sick of them all  thank 
      heaven  i am going to-morrow where i shall find a man who has not 
      one agreeable quality  who has neither manner nor sense to 
      recommend him  stupid men are the only ones worth knowing  after 
      all     
 
         take care  lizzy  that speech savours strongly of 
      disappointment     
 
      before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had 
      the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle 
      and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the 
      summer  
 
         we have not determined how far it shall carry us     said mrs  
      gardiner     but  perhaps  to the lakes     
 
      no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth  and her 
      acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful     oh  my 
      dear  dear aunt     she rapturously cried     what delight  what 
      felicity  you give me fresh life and vigour  adieu to 
      disappointment and spleen  what are young men to rocks and 
      mountains  oh  what hours of transport we shall spend  and when 
      we  do  return  it shall not be like other travellers  without 
      being able to give one accurate idea of anything  we  will  know 
      where we have gone   we  will  recollect what we have seen  lakes  
      mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our 
      imaginations  nor when we attempt to describe any particular 
      scene  will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  let 
       our  first effusions be less insupportable than those of the 
      generality of travellers     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 28 
 
      every object in the next day   s journey was new and interesting to 
      elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment  for she 
      had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her 
      health  and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant 
      source of delight  
 
      when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford  every eye 
      was in search of the parsonage  and every turning expected to 
      bring it in view  the palings of rosings park was their boundary 
      on one side  elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she 
      had heard of its inhabitants  
 
      at length the parsonage was discernible  the garden sloping to 
      the road  the house standing in it  the green pales  and the 
      laurel hedge  everything declared they were arriving  mr  collins 
      and charlotte appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at 
      the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house  
      amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party  in a moment they 
      were all out of the chaise  rejoicing at the sight of each other  
      mrs  collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and 
      elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found 
      herself so affectionately received  she saw instantly that her 
      cousin   s manners were not altered by his marriage  his formal 
      civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some 
      minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all 
      her family  they were then  with no other delay than his pointing 
      out the neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as 
      soon as they were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time  
      with ostentatious formality to his humble abode  and punctually 
      repeated all his wife   s offers of refreshment  
 
      elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not 
      help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the 
      room  its aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself 
      particularly to her  as if wishing to make her feel what she had 
      lost in refusing him  but though everything seemed neat and 
      comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of 
      repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she 
      could have so cheerful an air with such a companion  when mr  
      collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be 
      ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily 
      turned her eye on charlotte  once or twice she could discern a 
      faint blush  but in general charlotte wisely did not hear  after 
      sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the 
      room  from the sideboard to the fender  to give an account of 
      their journey  and of all that had happened in london  mr  
      collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden  which was 
      large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of which he 
      attended himself  to work in this garden was one of his most 
      respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of 
      countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of 
      the exercise  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible  
      here  leading the way through every walk and cross walk  and 
      scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked 
      for  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left 
      beauty entirely behind  he could number the fields in every 
      direction  and could tell how many trees there were in the most 
      distant clump  but of all the views which his garden  or which 
      the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with 
      the prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that 
      bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house  it was 
      a handsome modern building  well situated on rising ground  
 
      from his garden  mr  collins would have led them round his two 
      meadows  but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the 
      remains of a white frost  turned back  and while sir william 
      accompanied him  charlotte took her sister and friend over the 
      house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity 
      of showing it without her husband   s help  it was rather small  
      but well built and convenient  and everything was fitted up and 
      arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave 
      charlotte all the credit  when mr  collins could be forgotten  
      there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by 
      charlotte   s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must 
      be often forgotten  
 
      she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the 
      country  it was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when 
      mr  collins joining in  observed  
 
         yes  miss elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing lady 
      catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church  and i need 
      not say you will be delighted with her  she is all affability and 
      condescension  and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some 
      portion of her notice when service is over  i have scarcely any 
      hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in 
      every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here  
      her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming  we dine at 
      rosings twice every week  and are never allowed to walk home  her 
      ladyship   s carriage is regularly ordered for us  i  should  say  
      one of her ladyship   s carriages  for she has several     
 
         lady catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed     
      added charlotte     and a most attentive neighbour     
 
         very true  my dear  that is exactly what i say  she is the sort 
      of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference     
 
      the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news  
      and telling again what had already been written  and when it 
      closed  elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to 
      meditate upon charlotte   s degree of contentment  to understand 
      her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with  her 
      husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well  she 
      had also to anticipate how her visit would pass  the quiet tenor 
      of their usual employments  the vexatious interruptions of mr  
      collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings  a 
      lively imagination soon settled it all  
 
      about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting 
      ready for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole 
      house in confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard 
      somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly 
      after her  she opened the door and met maria in the landing 
      place  who  breathless with agitation  cried out    
 
         oh  my dear eliza  pray make haste and come into the 
      dining-room  for there is such a sight to be seen  i will not 
      tell you what it is  make haste  and come down this moment     
 
      elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing 
      more  and down they ran into the dining-room  which fronted the 
      lane  in quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a 
      low phaeton at the garden gate  
 
         and is this all     cried elizabeth     i expected at least that the 
      pigs were got into the garden  and here is nothing but lady 
      catherine and her daughter     
 
         la  my dear     said maria  quite shocked at the mistake     it is 
      not lady catherine  the old lady is mrs  jenkinson  who lives 
      with them  the other is miss de bourgh  only look at her  she is 
      quite a little creature  who would have thought that she could be 
      so thin and small     
 
         she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all 
      this wind  why does she not come in     
 
         oh  charlotte says she hardly ever does  it is the greatest of 
      favours when miss de bourgh comes in     
 
         i like her appearance     said elizabeth  struck with other ideas  
         she looks sickly and cross  yes  she will do for him very well  
      she will make him a very proper wife     
 
      mr  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in 
      conversation with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth   s 
      high diversion  was stationed in the doorway  in earnest 
      contemplation of the greatness before him  and constantly bowing 
      whenever miss de bourgh looked that way  
 
      at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on  
      and the others returned into the house  mr  collins no sooner saw 
      the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good 
      fortune  which charlotte explained by letting them know that the 
      whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 29 
 
      mr  collins   s triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was 
      complete  the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness 
      to his wondering visitors  and of letting them see her civility 
      towards himself and his wife  was exactly what he had wished for  
      and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon  was 
      such an instance of lady catherine   s condescension  as he knew 
      not how to admire enough  
 
         i confess     said he     that i should not have been at all 
      surprised by her ladyship   s asking us on sunday to drink tea and 
      spend the evening at rosings  i rather expected  from my 
      knowledge of her affability  that it would happen  but who could 
      have foreseen such an attention as this  who could have imagined 
      that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an 
      invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately 
      after your arrival     
 
         i am the less surprised at what has happened     replied sir 
      william     from that knowledge of what the manners of the great 
      really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire  
      about the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not 
      uncommon     
 
      scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but 
      their visit to rosings  mr  collins was carefully instructing 
      them in what they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms  
      so many servants  and so splendid a dinner  might not wholly 
      overpower them  
 
      when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to 
      elizabeth    
 
         do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel  
      lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us 
      which becomes herself and her daughter  i would advise you merely 
      to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest   there 
      is no occasion for anything more  lady catherine will not think 
      the worse of you for being simply dressed  she likes to have the 
      distinction of rank preserved     
 
      while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their 
      different doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady 
      catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner  
      such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of 
      living  quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to 
      company  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings 
      with as much apprehension as her father had done to his 
      presentation at st  james   s  
 
      as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a 
      mile across the park  every park has its beauty and its 
      prospects  and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she 
      could not be in such raptures as mr  collins expected the scene 
      to inspire  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of 
      the windows in front of the house  and his relation of what the 
      glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh  
 
      when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria   s alarm was every 
      moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly 
      calm  elizabeth   s courage did not fail her  she had heard nothing 
      of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary 
      talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money 
      or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation  
 
      from the entrance-hall  of which mr  collins pointed out  with a 
      rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments  
      they followed the servants through an ante-chamber  to the room 
      where lady catherine  her daughter  and mrs  jenkinson were 
      sitting  her ladyship  with great condescension  arose to receive 
      them  and as mrs  collins had settled it with her husband that 
      the office of introduction should be hers  it was performed in a 
      proper manner  without any of those apologies and thanks which he 
      would have thought necessary  
 
      in spite of having been at st  james   s  sir william was so 
      completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but 
      just courage enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat 
      without saying a word  and his daughter  frightened almost out of 
      her senses  sat on the edge of her chair  not knowing which way 
      to look  elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene  and 
      could observe the three ladies before her composedly  lady 
      catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly-marked features  
      which might once have been handsome  her air was not 
      conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to 
      make her visitors forget their inferior rank  she was not 
      rendered formidable by silence  but whatever she said was spoken 
      in so authoritative a tone  as marked her self-importance  and 
      brought mr  wickham immediately to elizabeth   s mind  and from the 
      observation of the day altogether  she believed lady catherine to 
      be exactly what he represented  
 
      when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and 
      deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr  darcy  she 
      turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in 
      maria   s astonishment at her being so thin and so small  there was 
      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies  miss 
      de bourgh was pale and sickly  her features  though not plain  
      were insignificant  and she spoke very little  except in a low 
      voice  to mrs  jenkinson  in whose appearance there was nothing 
      remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she 
      said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her 
      eyes  
 
      after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the 
      windows to admire the view  mr  collins attending them to point 
      out its beauties  and lady catherine kindly informing them that 
      it was much better worth looking at in the summer  
 
      the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the 
      servants and all the articles of plate which mr  collins had 
      promised  and  as he had likewise foretold  he took his seat at 
      the bottom of the table  by her ladyship   s desire  and looked as 
      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater  he carved  
      and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was 
      commended  first by him and then by sir william  who was now 
      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said  in a 
      manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear  but 
      lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration  
      and gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the 
      table proved a novelty to them  the party did not supply much 
      conversation  elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an 
      opening  but she was seated between charlotte and miss de 
      bourgh   the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady 
      catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time  
      mrs  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss 
      de bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing 
      she was indisposed  maria thought speaking out of the question  
      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire  
 
      when the ladies returned to the drawing-room  there was little to 
      be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without 
      any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on 
      every subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not 
      used to have her judgement controverted  she enquired into 
      charlotte   s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a 
      great deal of advice as to the management of them all  told her 
      how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as 
      hers  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her 
      poultry  elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great 
      lady   s attention  which could furnish her with an occasion of 
      dictating to others  in the intervals of her discourse with mrs  
      collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and 
      elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she 
      knew the least  and who she observed to mrs  collins was a very 
      genteel  pretty kind of girl  she asked her  at different times  
      how many sisters she had  whether they were older or younger than 
      herself  whether any of them were likely to be married  whether 
      they were handsome  where they had been educated  what carriage 
      her father kept  and what had been her mother   s maiden name  
      elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered 
      them very composedly  lady catherine then observed  
 
         your father   s estate is entailed on mr  collins  i think  for 
      your sake     turning to charlotte     i am glad of it  but otherwise 
      i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line  it 
      was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh   s family  do you 
      play and sing  miss bennet     
 
         a little     
 
         oh  then   some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  our 
      instrument is a capital one  probably superior to      you shall try 
      it some day  do your sisters play and sing     
 
         one of them does     
 
         why did not you all learn  you ought all to have learned  the 
      miss webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income 
      as yours  do you draw     
 
         no  not at all     
 
         what  none of you     
 
         not one     
 
         that is very strange  but i suppose you had no opportunity  your 
      mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit 
      of masters     
 
         my mother would have had no objection  but my father hates 
      london     
 
         has your governess left you     
 
         we never had any governess     
 
         no governess  how was that possible  five daughters brought up 
      at home without a governess  i never heard of such a thing  your 
      mother must have been quite a slave to your education     
 
      elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had 
      not been the case  
 
         then  who taught you  who attended to you  without a governess  
      you must have been neglected     
 
         compared with some families  i believe we were  but such of us 
      as wished to learn never wanted the means  we were always 
      encouraged to read  and had all the masters that were necessary  
      those who chose to be idle  certainly might     
 
         aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if 
      i had known your mother  i should have advised her most 
      strenuously to engage one  i always say that nothing is to be 
      done in education without steady and regular instruction  and 
      nobody but a governess can give it  it is wonderful how many 
      families i have been the means of supplying in that way  i am 
      always glad to get a young person well placed out  four nieces of 
      mrs  jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means  
      and it was but the other day that i recommended another young 
      person  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the 
      family are quite delighted with her  mrs  collins  did i tell you 
      of lady metcalf   s calling yesterday to thank me  she finds miss 
      pope a treasure     lady catherine     said she     you have given me a 
      treasure     are any of your younger sisters out  miss bennet     
 
         yes  ma   am  all     
 
         all  what  all five out at once  very odd  and you only the 
      second  the younger ones out before the elder ones are married  
      your younger sisters must be very young     
 
         yes  my youngest is not sixteen  perhaps  she  is full young to 
      be much in company  but really  ma   am  i think it would be very 
      hard upon younger sisters  that they should not have their share 
      of society and amusement  because the elder may not have the 
      means or inclination to marry early  the last-born has as good a 
      right to the pleasures of youth as the first  and to be kept back 
      on  such  a motive  i think it would not be very likely to 
      promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind     
 
         upon my word     said her ladyship     you give your opinion very 
      decidedly for so young a person  pray  what is your age     
 
         with three younger sisters grown up     replied elizabeth  
      smiling     your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it     
 
      lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct 
      answer  and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature 
      who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence  
 
         you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure  therefore you need 
      not conceal your age     
 
         i am not one-and-twenty     
 
      when the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the 
      card-tables were placed  lady catherine  sir william  and mr  and 
      mrs  collins sat down to quadrille  and as miss de bourgh chose 
      to play at cassino  the two girls had the honour of assisting 
      mrs  jenkinson to make up her party  their table was 
      superlatively stupid  scarcely a syllable was uttered that did 
      not relate to the game  except when mrs  jenkinson expressed her 
      fears of miss de bourgh   s being too hot or too cold  or having 
      too much or too little light  a great deal more passed at the 
      other table  lady catherine was generally speaking   stating the 
      mistakes of the three others  or relating some anecdote of 
      herself  mr  collins was employed in agreeing to everything her 
      ladyship said  thanking her for every fish he won  and 
      apologising if he thought he won too many  sir william did not 
      say much  he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble 
      names  
 
      when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they 
      chose  the tables were broken up  the carriage was offered to 
      mrs  collins  gratefully accepted and immediately ordered  the 
      party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine 
      determine what weather they were to have on the morrow  from 
      these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the 
      coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr  collins   s 
      side and as many bows on sir william   s they departed  as soon as 
      they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her 
      cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings  
      which  for charlotte   s sake  she made more favourable than it 
      really was  but her commendation  though costing her some 
      trouble  could by no means satisfy mr  collins  and he was very 
      soon obliged to take her ladyship   s praise into his own hands  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 30 
 
      sir william stayed only a week at hunsford  but his visit was 
      long enough to convince him of his daughter   s being most 
      comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and 
      such a neighbour as were not often met with  while sir william 
      was with them  mr  collins devoted his morning to driving him out 
      in his gig  and showing him the country  but when he went away  
      the whole family returned to their usual employments  and 
      elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her 
      cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between 
      breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the 
      garden or in reading and writing  and looking out of the window 
      in his own book-room  which fronted the road  the room in which 
      the ladies sat was backwards  elizabeth had at first rather 
      wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for 
      common use  it was a better sized room  and had a more pleasant 
      aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason 
      for what she did  for mr  collins would undoubtedly have been 
      much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally 
      lively  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement  
 
      from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane  
      and were indebted to mr  collins for the knowledge of what 
      carriages went along  and how often especially miss de bourgh 
      drove by in her phaeton  which he never failed coming to inform 
      them of  though it happened almost every day  she not 
      unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and had a few minutes    
      conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed upon 
      to get out  
 
      very few days passed in which mr  collins did not walk to 
      rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it 
      necessary to go likewise  and till elizabeth recollected that 
      there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could 
      not understand the sacrifice of so many hours  now and then they 
      were honoured with a call from her ladyship  and nothing escaped 
      her observation that was passing in the room during these visits  
      she examined into their employments  looked at their work  and 
      advised them to do it differently  found fault with the 
      arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in 
      negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it 
      only for the sake of finding out that mrs  collins   s joints of 
      meat were too large for her family  
 
      elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in 
      the commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active 
      magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were 
      carried to her by mr  collins  and whenever any of the cottagers 
      were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she 
      sallied forth into the village to settle their differences  
      silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty  
 
      the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a 
      week  and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being 
      only one card-table in the evening  every such entertainment was 
      the counterpart of the first  their other engagements were few  
      as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond 
      mr  collins   s reach  this  however  was no evil to elizabeth  and 
      upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were 
      half-hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte  and the 
      weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great 
      enjoyment out of doors  her favourite walk  and where she 
      frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine  
      was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where 
      there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but 
      herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine   s 
      curiosity  
 
      in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed 
      away  easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to 
      bring an addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a 
      circle must be important  elizabeth had heard soon after her 
      arrival that mr  darcy was expected there in the course of a few 
      weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom 
      she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively 
      new to look at in their rosings parties  and she might be amused 
      in seeing how hopeless miss bingley   s designs on him were  by his 
      behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by 
      lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest 
      satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration  
      and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been 
      frequently seen by miss lucas and herself  
 
      his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr  collins was 
      walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into 
      hunsford lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and 
      after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park  
      hurried home with the great intelligence  on the following 
      morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects  there were 
      two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for mr  darcy had 
      brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of his 
      uncle lord         and  to the great surprise of all the party  when 
      mr  collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him  charlotte 
      had seen them from her husband   s room  crossing the road  and 
      immediately running into the other  told the girls what an honour 
      they might expect  adding  
 
         i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility  mr  darcy 
      would never have come so soon to wait upon me     
 
      elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the 
      compliment  before their approach was announced by the door-bell  
      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room  
      colonel fitzwilliam  who led the way  was about thirty  not 
      handsome  but in person and address most truly the gentleman  mr  
      darcy looked just as he had been used to look in 
      hertfordshire   paid his compliments  with his usual reserve  to 
      mrs  collins  and whatever might be his feelings toward her 
      friend  met her with every appearance of composure  elizabeth 
      merely curtseyed to him without saying a word  
 
      colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the 
      readiness and ease of a well-bred man  and talked very 
      pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight 
      observation on the house and garden to mrs  collins  sat for some 
      time without speaking to anybody  at length  however  his 
      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the 
      health of her family  she answered him in the usual way  and 
      after a moment   s pause  added  
 
         my eldest sister has been in town these three months  have you 
      never happened to see her there     
 
      she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to 
      see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed 
      between the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little 
      confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to 
      meet miss bennet  the subject was pursued no farther  and the 
      gentlemen soon afterwards went away  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 31 
 
      colonel fitzwilliam   s manners were very much admired at the 
      parsonage  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably 
      to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings  it was some 
      days  however  before they received any invitation thither   for 
      while there were visitors in the house  they could not be 
      necessary  and it was not till easter-day  almost a week after 
      the gentlemen   s arrival  that they were honoured by such an 
      attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to 
      come there in the evening  for the last week they had seen very 
      little of lady catherine or her daughter  colonel fitzwilliam had 
      called at the parsonage more than once during the time  but mr  
      darcy they had seen only at church  
 
      the invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they 
      joined the party in lady catherine   s drawing-room  her ladyship 
      received them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by 
      no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she 
      was  in fact  almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them  
      especially to darcy  much more than to any other person in the 
      room  
 
      colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was 
      a welcome relief to him at rosings  and mrs  collins   s pretty 
      friend had moreover caught his fancy very much  he now seated 
      himself by her  and talked so agreeably of kent and 
      hertfordshire  of travelling and staying at home  of new books 
      and music  that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained 
      in that room before  and they conversed with so much spirit and 
      flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself  as well 
      as of mr  darcy   his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned 
      towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship  
      after a while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged  
      for she did not scruple to call out  
 
         what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam  what is it you are 
      talking of  what are you telling miss bennet  let me hear what it 
      is     
 
         we are speaking of music  madam     said he  when no longer able 
      to avoid a reply  
 
         of music  then pray speak aloud  it is of all subjects my 
      delight  i must have my share in the conversation if you are 
      speaking of music  there are few people in england  i suppose  
      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself  or a better 
      natural taste  if i had ever learnt  i should have been a great 
      proficient  and so would anne  if her health had allowed her to 
      apply  i am confident that she would have performed delightfully  
      how does georgiana get on  darcy     
 
      mr  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister   s 
      proficiency  
 
         i am very glad to hear such a good account of her     said lady 
      catherine     and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to 
      excel if she does not practice a good deal     
 
         i assure you  madam     he replied     that she does not need such 
      advice  she practises very constantly     
 
         so much the better  it cannot be done too much  and when i next 
      write to her  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any 
      account  i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is 
      to be acquired without constant practice  i have told miss bennet 
      several times  that she will never play really well unless she 
      practises more  and though mrs  collins has no instrument  she is 
      very welcome  as i have often told her  to come to rosings every 
      day  and play on the pianoforte in mrs  jenkinson   s room  she 
      would be in nobody   s way  you know  in that part of the house     
 
      mr  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt   s ill-breeding  and 
      made no answer  
 
      when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of 
      having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the 
      instrument  he drew a chair near her  lady catherine listened to 
      half a song  and then talked  as before  to her other nephew  
      till the latter walked away from her  and making with his usual 
      deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to 
      command a full view of the fair performer   s countenance  
      elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first convenient 
      pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said  
 
         you mean to frighten me  mr  darcy  by coming in all this state 
      to hear me  i will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play 
      so well  there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to 
      be frightened at the will of others  my courage always rises at 
      every attempt to intimidate me     
 
         i shall not say you are mistaken     he replied     because you 
      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming 
      you  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough 
      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing 
      opinions which in fact are not your own     
 
      elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said 
      to colonel fitzwilliam     your cousin will give you a very pretty 
      notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word i say  i am 
      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose 
      my real character  in a part of the world where i had hoped to 
      pass myself off with some degree of credit  indeed  mr  darcy  it 
      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my 
      disadvantage in hertfordshire   and  give me leave to say  very 
      impolitic too   for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such 
      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear     
 
         i am not afraid of you     said he  smilingly  
 
         pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of     cried colonel 
      fitzwilliam     i should like to know how he behaves among 
      strangers     
 
         you shall hear then   but prepare yourself for something very 
      dreadful  the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire  
      you must know  was at a ball   and at this ball  what do you think 
      he did  he danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce  
      and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was 
      sitting down in want of a partner  mr  darcy  you cannot deny the 
      fact     
 
         i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the 
      assembly beyond my own party     
 
         true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room  well  
      colonel fitzwilliam  what do i play next  my fingers wait your 
      orders     
 
         perhaps     said darcy     i should have judged better  had i sought 
      an introduction  but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to 
      strangers     
 
         shall we ask your cousin the reason of this     said elizabeth  
      still addressing colonel fitzwilliam     shall we ask him why a man 
      of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill 
      qualified to recommend himself to strangers     
 
         i can answer your question     said fitzwilliam     without applying 
      to him  it is because he will not give himself the trouble     
 
         i certainly have not the talent which some people possess     said 
      darcy     of conversing easily with those i have never seen before  
      i cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested 
      in their concerns  as i often see done     
 
         my fingers     said elizabeth     do not move over this instrument 
      in the masterly manner which i see so many women   s do  they have 
      not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same 
      expression  but then i have always supposed it to be my own 
      fault   because i will not take the trouble of practising  it is 
      not that i do not believe  my  fingers as capable as any other 
      woman   s of superior execution     
 
      darcy smiled and said     you are perfectly right  you have 
      employed your time much better  no one admitted to the privilege 
      of hearing you can think anything wanting  we neither of us 
      perform to strangers     
 
      here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to 
      know what they were talking of  elizabeth immediately began 
      playing again  lady catherine approached  and  after listening 
      for a few minutes  said to darcy  
 
         miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more  
      and could have the advantage of a london master  she has a very 
      good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to 
      anne   s  anne would have been a delightful performer  had her 
      health allowed her to learn     
 
      elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his 
      cousin   s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other 
      could she discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his 
      behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss 
      bingley  that he might have been just as likely to marry  her   
      had she been his relation  
 
      lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth   s performance  
      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste  
      elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility  
      and  at the request of the gentlemen  remained at the instrument 
      till her ladyship   s carriage was ready to take them all home  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 32 
 
      elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to 
      jane while mrs  collins and maria were gone on business into the 
      village  when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain 
      signal of a visitor  as she had heard no carriage  she thought it 
      not unlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprehension 
      was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape 
      all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and  to her very 
      great surprise  mr  darcy  and mr  darcy only  entered the room  
 
      he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for 
      his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the 
      ladies were to be within  
 
      they then sat down  and when her enquiries after rosings were 
      made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  it was 
      absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in 
      this emergence recollecting  when  she had seen him last in 
      hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on 
      the subject of their hasty departure  she observed  
 
         how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr  
      darcy  it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr  bingley 
      to see you all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he 
      went but the day before  he and his sisters were well  i hope  
      when you left london     
 
         perfectly so  i thank you     
 
      she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a 
      short pause added  
 
         i think i have understood that mr  bingley has not much idea of 
      ever returning to netherfield again     
 
         i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may 
      spend very little of his time there in the future  he has many 
      friends  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements 
      are continually increasing     
 
         if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better 
      for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  
      for then we might possibly get a settled family there  but  
      perhaps  mr  bingley did not take the house so much for the 
      convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must 
      expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle     
 
         i should not be surprised     said darcy     if he were to give it 
      up as soon as any eligible purchase offers     
 
      elizabeth made no answer  she was afraid of talking longer of his 
      friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to 
      leave the trouble of finding a subject to him  
 
      he took the hint  and soon began with     this seems a very 
      comfortable house  lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to 
      it when mr  collins first came to hunsford     
 
         i believe she did   and i am sure she could not have bestowed her 
      kindness on a more grateful object     
 
         mr  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a 
      wife     
 
         yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with 
      one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him  
      or have made him happy if they had  my friend has an excellent 
      understanding   though i am not certain that i consider her 
      marrying mr  collins as the wisest thing she ever did  she seems 
      perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light it is 
      certainly a very good match for her     
 
         it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a 
      distance of her own family and friends     
 
         an easy distance  do you call it  it is nearly fifty miles     
 
         and what is fifty miles of good road  little more than half a 
      day   s journey  yes  i call it a very easy distance     
 
         i should never have considered the distance as one of the 
       advantages  of the match     cried elizabeth     i should never have 
      said mrs  collins was settled  near  her family     
 
         it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire  anything 
      beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would 
      appear far     
 
      as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she 
      understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and 
      netherfield  and she blushed as she answered  
 
         i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near 
      her family  the far and the near must be relative  and depend on 
      many varying circumstances  where there is fortune to make the 
      expenses of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  but 
      that is not the case  here   mr  and mrs  collins have a 
      comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent 
      journeys   and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself 
       near  her family under less than  half  the present distance     
 
      mr  darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said      you  
      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment   you  
      cannot have been always at longbourn     
 
      elizabeth looked surprised  the gentleman experienced some change 
      of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the 
      table  and glancing over it  said  in a colder voice  
 
         are you pleased with kent     
 
      a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either 
      side calm and concise   and soon put an end to by the entrance of 
      charlotte and her sister  just returned from her walk  the 
       t  te-  -t  te  surprised them  mr  darcy related the mistake which 
      had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet  and after sitting a 
      few minutes longer without saying much to anybody  went away  
 
         what can be the meaning of this     said charlotte  as soon as he 
      was gone     my dear  eliza  he must be in love with you  or he 
      would never have called on us in this familiar way     
 
      but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very 
      likely  even to charlotte   s wishes  to be the case  and after 
      various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to 
      proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was 
      the more probable from the time of year  all field sports were 
      over  within doors there was lady catherine  books  and a 
      billiard-table  but gentlemen cannot always be within doors  and 
      in the nearness of the parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk 
      to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a 
      temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day  
      they called at various times of the morning  sometimes 
      separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by 
      their aunt  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam 
      came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which 
      of course recommended him still more  and elizabeth was reminded 
      by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his 
      evident admiration of her  of her former favourite george 
      wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less 
      captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam   s manners  she 
      believed he might have the best informed mind  
 
      but why mr  darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more 
      difficult to understand  it could not be for society  as he 
      frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his 
      lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity 
      rather than of choice   a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to 
      himself  he seldom appeared really animated  mrs  collins knew 
      not what to make of him  colonel fitzwilliam   s occasionally 
      laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was generally 
      different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told 
      her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the 
      effect of love  and the object of that love her friend eliza  she 
      set herself seriously to work to find it out  she watched him 
      whenever they were at rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford  
      but without much success  he certainly looked at her friend a 
      great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable  it 
      was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether 
      there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing 
      but absence of mind  
 
      she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of 
      his being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the 
      idea  and mrs  collins did not think it right to press the 
      subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only 
      end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a 
      doubt  that all her friend   s dislike would vanish  if she could 
      suppose him to be in her power  
 
      in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her 
      marrying colonel fitzwilliam  he was beyond comparison the most 
      pleasant man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life 
      was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  mr  
      darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin 
      could have none at all  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 33 
 
      more than once did elizabeth  in her ramble within the park  
      unexpectedly meet mr  darcy  she felt all the perverseness of the 
      mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  
      and  to prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him 
      at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers  how it could 
      occur a second time  therefore  was very odd  yet it did  and 
      even a third  it seemed like wilful ill-nature  or a voluntary 
      penance  for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal 
      enquiries and an awkward pause and then away  but he actually 
      thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  he never 
      said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of 
      talking or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of 
      their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected 
      questions   about her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of 
      solitary walks  and her opinion of mr  and mrs  collins   s 
      happiness  and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly 
      understanding the house  he seemed to expect that whenever she 
      came into kent again she would be staying  there  too  his words 
      seemed to imply it  could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his 
      thoughts  she supposed  if he meant anything  he must mean an 
      allusion to what might arise in that quarter  it distressed her a 
      little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the 
      pales opposite the parsonage  
 
      she was engaged one day as she walked  in perusing jane   s last 
      letter  and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had 
      not written in spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by 
      mr  darcy  she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was 
      meeting her  putting away the letter immediately and forcing a 
      smile  she said  
 
         i did not know before that you ever walked this way     
 
         i have been making the tour of the park     he replied     as i 
      generally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at 
      the parsonage  are you going much farther     
 
         no  i should have turned in a moment     
 
      and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the 
      parsonage together  
 
         do you certainly leave kent on saturday     said she  
 
         yes   if darcy does not put it off again  but i am at his 
      disposal  he arranges the business just as he pleases     
 
         and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at 
      least pleasure in the great power of choice  i do not know 
      anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes 
      than mr  darcy     
 
         he likes to have his own way very well     replied colonel 
      fitzwilliam     but so we all do  it is only that he has better 
      means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many 
      others are poor  i speak feelingly  a younger son  you know  must 
      be inured to self-denial and dependence     
 
         in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little 
      of either  now seriously  what have you ever known of self-denial 
      and dependence  when have you been prevented by want of money 
      from going wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a 
      fancy for     
 
         these are home questions   and perhaps i cannot say that i have 
      experienced many hardships of that nature  but in matters of 
      greater weight  i may suffer from want of money  younger sons 
      cannot marry where they like     
 
         unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very 
      often do     
 
         our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not 
      many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some 
      attention to money     
 
         is this     thought elizabeth     meant for me     and she coloured at 
      the idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone     and 
      pray  what is the usual price of an earl   s younger son  unless 
      the elder brother is very sickly  i suppose you would not ask 
      above fifty thousand pounds     
 
      he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped  to 
      interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with 
      what had passed  she soon afterwards said  
 
         i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the 
      sake of having someone at his disposal  i wonder he does not 
      marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind  but  
      perhaps  his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is 
      under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her     
 
         no     said colonel fitzwilliam     that is an advantage which he 
      must divide with me  i am joined with him in the guardianship of 
      miss darcy     
 
         are you indeed  and pray what sort of guardians do you make  
      does your charge give you much trouble  young ladies of her age 
      are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the 
      true darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way     
 
      as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the 
      manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss 
      darcy likely to give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she 
      had somehow or other got pretty near the truth  she directly 
      replied  
 
         you need not be frightened  i never heard any harm of her  and i 
      dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world  
      she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my 
      acquaintance  mrs  hurst and miss bingley  i think i have heard 
      you say that you know them     
 
         i know them a little  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike 
      man   he is a great friend of darcy   s     
 
         oh  yes     said elizabeth drily     mr  darcy is uncommonly kind to 
      mr  bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him     
 
         care of him  yes  i really believe darcy  does  take care of him 
      in those points where he most wants care  from something that he 
      told me in our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley 
      very much indebted to him  but i ought to beg his pardon  for i 
      have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant  it 
      was all conjecture     
 
         what is it you mean     
 
         it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally 
      known  because if it were to get round to the lady   s family  it 
      would be an unpleasant thing     
 
         you may depend upon my not mentioning it     
 
         and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be 
      bingley  what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated 
      himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences 
      of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any 
      other particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from 
      believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that 
      sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of 
      last summer     
 
         did mr  darcy give you reasons for this interference     
 
         i understood that there were some very strong objections against 
      the lady     
 
         and what arts did he use to separate them     
 
         he did not talk to me of his own arts     said fitzwilliam  
      smiling     he only told me what i have now told you     
 
      elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with 
      indignation  after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her 
      why she was so thoughtful  
 
         i am thinking of what you have been telling me     said she     your 
      cousin   s conduct does not suit my feelings  why was he to be the 
      judge     
 
         you are rather disposed to call his interference officious     
 
         i do not see what right mr  darcy had to decide on the propriety 
      of his friend   s inclination  or why  upon his own judgement 
      alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend 
      was to be happy  but     she continued  recollecting herself     as 
      we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him  
      it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the 
      case     
 
         that is not an unnatural surmise     said fitzwilliam     but it is 
      a lessening of the honour of my cousin   s triumph very sadly     
 
      this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a 
      picture of mr  darcy  that she would not trust herself with an 
      answer  and therefore  abruptly changing the conversation talked 
      on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage  there  
      shut into her own room  as soon as their visitor left them  she 
      could think without interruption of all that she had heard  it 
      was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than 
      those with whom she was connected  there could not exist in the 
      world  two  men over whom mr  darcy could have such boundless 
      influence  that he had been concerned in the measures taken to 
      separate bingley and jane she had never doubted  but she had 
      always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and 
      arrangement of them  if his own vanity  however  did not mislead 
      him   he  was the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause  of 
      all that jane had suffered  and still continued to suffer  he had 
      ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most 
      affectionate  generous heart in the world  and no one could say 
      how lasting an evil he might have inflicted  
 
         there were some very strong objections against the lady     were 
      colonel fitzwilliam   s words  and those strong objections probably 
      were  her having one uncle who was a country attorney  and 
      another who was in business in london  
 
         to jane herself     she exclaimed     there could be no possibility 
      of objection  all loveliness and goodness as she is    her 
      understanding excellent  her mind improved  and her manners 
      captivating  neither could anything be urged against my father  
      who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities mr  darcy 
      himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will 
      probably never reach     when she thought of her mother  her 
      confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow that any 
      objections  there  had material weight with mr  darcy  whose 
      pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the 
      want of importance in his friend   s connections  than from their 
      want of sense  and she was quite decided  at last  that he had 
      been partly governed by this worst kind of pride  and partly by 
      the wish of retaining mr  bingley for his sister  
 
      the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on 
      a headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening  that  
      added to her unwillingness to see mr  darcy  it determined her 
      not to attend her cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to 
      drink tea  mrs  collins  seeing that she was really unwell  did 
      not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband 
      from pressing her  but mr  collins could not conceal his 
      apprehension of lady catherine   s being rather displeased by her 
      staying at home  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 34 
 
      when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate 
      herself as much as possible against mr  darcy  chose for her 
      employment the examination of all the letters which jane had 
      written to her since her being in kent  they contained no actual 
      complaint  nor was there any revival of past occurrences  or any 
      communication of present suffering  but in all  and in almost 
      every line of each  there was a want of that cheerfulness which 
      had been used to characterise her style  and which  proceeding 
      from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly 
      disposed towards everyone  had been scarcely ever clouded  
      elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of 
      uneasiness  with an attention which it had hardly received on the 
      first perusal  mr  darcy   s shameful boast of what misery he had 
      been able to inflict  gave her a keener sense of her sister   s 
      sufferings  it was some consolation to think that his visit to 
      rosings was to end on the day after the next   and  a still 
      greater  that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with 
      jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her 
      spirits  by all that affection could do  
 
      she could not think of darcy   s leaving kent without remembering 
      that his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had 
      made it clear that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as 
      he was  she did not mean to be unhappy about him  
 
      while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound 
      of the door-bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the 
      idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once 
      before called late in the evening  and might now come to enquire 
      particularly after her  but this idea was soon banished  and her 
      spirits were very differently affected  when  to her utter 
      amazement  she saw mr  darcy walk into the room  in an hurried 
      manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health  imputing 
      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better  she answered 
      him with cold civility  he sat down for a few moments  and then 
      getting up  walked about the room  elizabeth was surprised  but 
      said not a word  after a silence of several minutes  he came 
      towards her in an agitated manner  and thus began  
 
         in vain i have struggled  it will not do  my feelings will not 
      be repressed  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire 
      and love you     
 
      elizabeth   s astonishment was beyond expression  she stared  
      coloured  doubted  and was silent  this he considered sufficient 
      encouragement  and the avowal of all that he felt  and had long 
      felt for her  immediately followed  he spoke well  but there were 
      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed  and he was 
      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride  his 
      sense of her inferiority   of its being a degradation   of the family 
      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination  were dwelt on 
      with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was 
      wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his suit  
 
      in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike  she could not be 
      insensible to the compliment of such a man   s affection  and 
      though her intentions did not vary for an instant  she was at 
      first sorry for the pain he was to receive  till  roused to 
      resentment by his subsequent language  she lost all compassion in 
      anger  she tried  however  to compose herself to answer him with 
      patience  when he should have done  he concluded with 
      representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in 
      spite of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer  
      and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her 
      acceptance of his hand  as he said this  she could easily see 
      that he had no doubt of a favourable answer  he  spoke  of 
      apprehension and anxiety  but his countenance expressed real 
      security  such a circumstance could only exasperate farther  and  
      when he ceased  the colour rose into her cheeks  and she said  
 
         in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to 
      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however 
      unequally they may be returned  it is natural that obligation 
      should be felt  and if i could  feel  gratitude  i would now 
      thank you  but i cannot   i have never desired your good opinion  
      and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly  i am sorry 
      to have occasioned pain to anyone  it has been most unconsciously 
      done  however  and i hope will be of short duration  the feelings 
      which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of 
      your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after 
      this explanation     
 
      mr  darcy  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes 
      fixed on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less 
      resentment than surprise  his complexion became pale with anger  
      and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature  he 
      was struggling for the appearance of composure  and would not 
      open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it  the 
      pause was to elizabeth   s feelings dreadful  at length  with a 
      voice of forced calmness  he said  
 
         and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of 
      expecting  i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so 
      little  endeavour  at civility  i am thus rejected  but it is of 
      small importance     
 
         i might as well enquire     replied she     why with so evident a 
      desire of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that 
      you liked me against your will  against your reason  and even 
      against your character  was not this some excuse for incivility  
      if i  was  uncivil  but i have other provocations  you know i 
      have  had not my feelings decided against you   had they been 
      indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that 
      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been 
      the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most 
      beloved sister     
 
      as she pronounced these words  mr  darcy changed colour  but the 
      emotion was short  and he listened without attempting to 
      interrupt her while she continued  
 
         i have every reason in the world to think ill of you  no motive 
      can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there   you 
      dare not  you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if 
      not the only means of dividing them from each other   of exposing 
      one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  and 
      the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving 
      them both in misery of the acutest kind     
 
      she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was 
      listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any 
      feeling of remorse  he even looked at her with a smile of 
      affected incredulity  
 
         can you deny that you have done it     she repeated  
 
      with assumed tranquillity he then replied     i have no wish of 
      denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend 
      from your sister  or that i rejoice in my success  towards  him  
      i have been kinder than towards myself     
 
      elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil 
      reflection  but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to 
      conciliate her  
 
         but it is not merely this affair     she continued     on which my 
      dislike is founded  long before it had taken place my opinion of 
      you was decided  your character was unfolded in the recital which 
      i received many months ago from mr  wickham  on this subject  
      what can you have to say  in what imaginary act of friendship can 
      you here defend yourself  or under what misrepresentation can you 
      here impose upon others     
 
         you take an eager interest in that gentleman   s concerns     said 
      darcy  in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour  
 
         who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling 
      an interest in him     
 
         his misfortunes     repeated darcy contemptuously     yes  his 
      misfortunes have been great indeed     
 
         and of your infliction     cried elizabeth with energy     you have 
      reduced him to his present state of poverty   comparative poverty  
      you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been 
      designed for him  you have deprived the best years of his life of 
      that independence which was no less his due than his desert  you 
      have done all this  and yet you can treat the mention of his 
      misfortune with contempt and ridicule     
 
         and this     cried darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the 
      room     is your opinion of me  this is the estimation in which you 
      hold me  i thank you for explaining it so fully  my faults  
      according to this calculation  are heavy indeed  but perhaps     
      added he  stopping in his walk  and turning towards her     these 
      offenses might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt 
      by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented 
      my forming any serious design  these bitter accusations might 
      have been suppressed  had i  with greater policy  concealed my 
      struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled 
      by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by reflection  
      by everything  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  nor 
      am i ashamed of the feelings i related  they were natural and 
      just  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your 
      connections    to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  
      whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own     
 
      elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she 
      tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said  
 
         you are mistaken  mr  darcy  if you suppose that the mode of 
      your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared 
      me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you  had you 
      behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner     
 
      she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she 
      continued  
 
         you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible 
      way that would have tempted me to accept it     
 
      again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an 
      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  she went on  
 
         from the very beginning   from the first moment  i may almost 
      say   of my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with 
      the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your 
      selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form 
      the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have 
      built so immovable a dislike  and i had not known you a month 
      before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i 
      could ever be prevailed on to marry     
 
         you have said quite enough  madam  i perfectly comprehend your 
      feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have 
      been  forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and 
      accept my best wishes for your health and happiness     
 
      and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth 
      heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house  
 
      the tumult of her mind  was now painfully great  she knew not how 
      to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried 
      for half-an-hour  her astonishment  as she reflected on what had 
      passed  was increased by every review of it  that she should 
      receive an offer of marriage from mr  darcy  that he should have 
      been in love with her for so many months  so much in love as to 
      wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made 
      him prevent his friend   s marrying her sister  and which must 
      appear at least with equal force in his own case   was almost 
      incredible  it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so 
      strong an affection  but his pride  his abominable pride   his 
      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane   his 
      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could not 
      justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned 
      mr  wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to 
      deny  soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his 
      attachment had for a moment excited  she continued in very 
      agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherine   s carriage 
      made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte   s 
      observation  and hurried her away to her room  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 35 
 
      elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and 
      meditations which had at length closed her eyes  she could not 
      yet recover from the surprise of what had happened  it was 
      impossible to think of anything else  and  totally indisposed for 
      employment  she resolved  soon after breakfast  to indulge 
      herself in air and exercise  she was proceeding directly to her 
      favourite walk  when the recollection of mr  darcy   s sometimes 
      coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park  she 
      turned up the lane  which led farther from the turnpike-road  the 
      park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon 
      passed one of the gates into the ground  
 
      after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she 
      was tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the 
      gates and look into the park  the five weeks which she had now 
      passed in kent had made a great difference in the country  and 
      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees  she was 
      on the point of continuing her walk  when she caught a glimpse of 
      a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park  he was 
      moving that way  and  fearful of its being mr  darcy  she was 
      directly retreating  but the person who advanced was now near 
      enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness  
      pronounced her name  she had turned away  but on hearing herself 
      called  though in a voice which proved it to be mr  darcy  she 
      moved again towards the gate  he had by that time reached it 
      also  and  holding out a letter  which she instinctively took  
      said  with a look of haughty composure     i have been walking in 
      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  will you do me 
      the honour of reading that letter     and then  with a slight bow  
      turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight  
 
      with no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest 
      curiosity  elizabeth opened the letter  and  to her still 
      increasing wonder  perceived an envelope containing two sheets of 
      letter-paper  written quite through  in a very close hand  the 
      envelope itself was likewise full  pursuing her way along the 
      lane  she then began it  it was dated from rosings  at eight 
      o   clock in the morning  and was as follows     
 
         be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the 
      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments 
      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to 
      you  i write without any intention of paining you  or humbling 
      myself  by dwelling on wishes which  for the happiness of both  
      cannot be too soon forgotten  and the effort which the formation 
      and the perusal of this letter must occasion  should have been 
      spared  had not my character required it to be written and read  
      you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand your 
      attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but 
      i demand it of your justice  
 
         two offenses of a very different nature  and by no means of 
      equal magnitude  you last night laid to my charge  the first 
      mentioned was  that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i 
      had detached mr  bingley from your sister  and the other  that i 
      had  in defiance of various claims  in defiance of honour and 
      humanity  ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the 
      prospects of mr  wickham  wilfully and wantonly to have thrown 
      off the companion of my youth  the acknowledged favourite of my 
      father  a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on 
      our patronage  and who had been brought up to expect its 
      exertion  would be a depravity  to which the separation of two 
      young persons  whose affection could be the growth of only a few 
      weeks  could bear no comparison  but from the severity of that 
      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed  respecting each 
      circumstance  i shall hope to be in the future secured  when the 
      following account of my actions and their motives has been read  
      if  in the explanation of them  which is due to myself  i am 
      under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive 
      to yours  i can only say that i am sorry  the necessity must be 
      obeyed  and further apology would be absurd  
 
         i had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common 
      with others  that bingley preferred your elder sister to any 
      other young woman in the country  but it was not till the evening 
      of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his 
      feeling a serious attachment  i had often seen him in love 
      before  at that ball  while i had the honour of dancing with you  
      i was first made acquainted  by sir william lucas   s accidental 
      information  that bingley   s attentions to your sister had given 
      rise to a general expectation of their marriage  he spoke of it 
      as a certain event  of which the time alone could be undecided  
      from that moment i observed my friend   s behaviour attentively  
      and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was 
      beyond what i had ever witnessed in him  your sister i also 
      watched  her look and manners were open  cheerful  and engaging 
      as ever  but without any symptom of peculiar regard  and i 
      remained convinced from the evening   s scrutiny  that though she 
      received his attentions with pleasure  she did not invite them by 
      any participation of sentiment  if  you  have not been mistaken 
      here   i  must have been in error  your superior knowledge of 
      your sister must make the latter probable  if it be so  if i have 
      been misled by such error to inflict pain on her  your resentment 
      has not been unreasonable  but i shall not scruple to assert  
      that the serenity of your sister   s countenance and air was such 
      as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that  
      however amiable her temper  her heart was not likely to be easily 
      touched  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is 
      certain   but i will venture to say that my investigation and 
      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  i did 
      not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it  i believed 
      it on impartial conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason  my 
      objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last 
      night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion 
      to put aside  in my own case  the want of connection could not be 
      so great an evil to my friend as to me  but there were other 
      causes of repugnance  causes which  though still existing  and 
      existing to an equal degree in both instances  i had myself 
      endeavoured to forget  because they were not immediately before 
      me  these causes must be stated  though briefly  the situation of 
      your mother   s family  though objectionable  was nothing in 
      comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently  so 
      almost uniformly betrayed by herself  by your three younger 
      sisters  and occasionally even by your father  pardon me  it 
      pains me to offend you  but amidst your concern for the defects 
      of your nearest relations  and your displeasure at this 
      representation of them  let it give you consolation to consider 
      that  to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of 
      the like censure  is praise no less generally bestowed on you and 
      your elder sister  than it is honourable to the sense and 
      disposition of both  i will only say farther that from what 
      passed that evening  my opinion of all parties was confirmed  and 
      every inducement heightened which could have led me before  to 
      preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy 
      connection  he left netherfield for london  on the day following  
      as you  i am certain  remember  with the design of soon 
      returning  
 
         the part which i acted is now to be explained  his sisters    
      uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  our coincidence 
      of feeling was soon discovered  and  alike sensible that no time 
      was to be lost in detaching their brother  we shortly resolved on 
      joining him directly in london  we accordingly went   and there i 
      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the 
      certain evils of such a choice  i described  and enforced them 
      earnestly  but  however this remonstrance might have staggered or 
      delayed his determination  i do not suppose that it would 
      ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been seconded 
      by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving  of your sister   s 
      indifference  he had before believed her to return his affection 
      with sincere  if not with equal regard  but bingley has great 
      natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than 
      on his own  to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived 
      himself  was no very difficult point  to persuade him against 
      returning into hertfordshire  when that conviction had been 
      given  was scarcely the work of a moment  i cannot blame myself 
      for having done thus much  there is but one part of my conduct in 
      the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction  it 
      is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to 
      conceal from him your sister   s being in town  i knew it myself  
      as it was known to miss bingley  but her brother is even yet 
      ignorant of it  that they might have met without ill consequence 
      is perhaps probable  but his regard did not appear to me enough 
      extinguished for him to see her without some danger  perhaps this 
      concealment  this disguise was beneath me  it is done  however  
      and it was done for the best  on this subject i have nothing more 
      to say  no other apology to offer  if i have wounded your 
      sister   s feelings  it was unknowingly done and though the motives 
      which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient  
      i have not yet learnt to condemn them  
 
         with respect to that other  more weighty accusation  of having 
      injured mr  wickham  i can only refute it by laying before you 
      the whole of his connection with my family  of what he has 
       particularly  accused me i am ignorant  but of the truth of what 
      i shall relate  i can summon more than one witness of undoubted 
      veracity  
 
         mr  wickham is the son of a very respectable man  who had for 
      many years the management of all the pemberley estates  and whose 
      good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my 
      father to be of service to him  and on george wickham  who was 
      his godson  his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  my 
      father supported him at school  and afterwards at cambridge   most 
      important assistance  as his own father  always poor from the 
      extravagance of his wife  would have been unable to give him a 
      gentleman   s education  my father was not only fond of this young 
      man   s society  whose manners were always engaging  he had also 
      the highest opinion of him  and hoping the church would be his 
      profession  intended to provide for him in it  as for myself  it 
      is many  many years since i first began to think of him in a very 
      different manner  the vicious propensities   the want of principle  
      which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best 
      friend  could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly 
      the same age with himself  and who had opportunities of seeing 
      him in unguarded moments  which mr  darcy could not have  here 
      again i shall give you pain   to what degree you only can tell  but 
      whatever may be the sentiments which mr  wickham has created  a 
      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his 
      real character   it adds even another motive  
 
         my excellent father died about five years ago  and his 
      attachment to mr  wickham was to the last so steady  that in his 
      will he particularly recommended it to me  to promote his 
      advancement in the best manner that his profession might 
      allow   and if he took orders  desired that a valuable family 
      living might be his as soon as it became vacant  there was also a 
      legacy of one thousand pounds  his own father did not long 
      survive mine  and within half a year from these events  mr  
      wickham wrote to inform me that  having finally resolved against 
      taking orders  he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for 
      him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage  in lieu of 
      the preferment  by which he could not be benefited  he had some 
      intention  he added  of studying law  and i must be aware that 
      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient 
      support therein  i rather wished  than believed him to be 
      sincere  but  at any rate  was perfectly ready to accede to his 
      proposal  i knew that mr  wickham ought not to be a clergyman  
      the business was therefore soon settled   he resigned all claim to 
      assistance in the church  were it possible that he could ever be 
      in a situation to receive it  and accepted in return three 
      thousand pounds  all connection between us seemed now dissolved  
      i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley  or admit his 
      society in town  in town i believe he chiefly lived  but his 
      studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free from all 
      restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation  for 
      about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of 
      the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he 
      applied to me again by letter for the presentation  his 
      circumstances  he assured me  and i had no difficulty in 
      believing it  were exceedingly bad  he had found the law a most 
      unprofitable study  and was now absolutely resolved on being 
      ordained  if i would present him to the living in question   of 
      which he trusted there could be little doubt  as he was well 
      assured that i had no other person to provide for  and i could 
      not have forgotten my revered father   s intentions  you will 
      hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty  or for 
      resisting every repetition to it  his resentment was in 
      proportion to the distress of his circumstances   and he was 
      doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his 
      reproaches to myself  after this period every appearance of 
      acquaintance was dropped  how he lived i know not  but last 
      summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice  
 
         i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget 
      myself  and which no obligation less than the present should 
      induce me to unfold to any human being  having said thus much  i 
      feel no doubt of your secrecy  my sister  who is more than ten 
      years my junior  was left to the guardianship of my mother   s 
      nephew  colonel fitzwilliam  and myself  about a year ago  she 
      was taken from school  and an establishment formed for her in 
      london  and last summer she went with the lady who presided over 
      it  to ramsgate  and thither also went mr  wickham  undoubtedly 
      by design  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance 
      between him and mrs  younge  in whose character we were most 
      unhappily deceived  and by her connivance and aid  he so far 
      recommended himself to georgiana  whose affectionate heart 
      retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child  
      that she was persuaded to believe herself in love  and to consent 
      to an elopement  she was then but fifteen  which must be her 
      excuse  and after stating her imprudence  i am happy to add  that 
      i owed the knowledge of it to herself  i joined them unexpectedly 
      a day or two before the intended elopement  and then georgiana  
      unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother 
      whom she almost looked up to as a father  acknowledged the whole 
      to me  you may imagine what i felt and how i acted  regard for my 
      sister   s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure  but i 
      wrote to mr  wickham  who left the place immediately  and mrs  
      younge was of course removed from her charge  mr  wickham   s chief 
      object was unquestionably my sister   s fortune  which is thirty 
      thousand pounds  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of 
      revenging himself on me was a strong inducement  his revenge 
      would have been complete indeed  
 
         this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we 
      have been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject 
      it as false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty 
      towards mr  wickham  i know not in what manner  under what form 
      of falsehood he had imposed on you  but his success is not 
      perhaps to be wondered at  ignorant as you previously were of 
      everything concerning either  detection could not be in your 
      power  and suspicion certainly not in your inclination  
 
         you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last 
      night  but i was not then master enough of myself to know what 
      could or ought to be revealed  for the truth of everything here 
      related  i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of 
      colonel fitzwilliam  who  from our near relationship and constant 
      intimacy  and  still more  as one of the executors of my father   s 
      will  has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of 
      these transactions  if your abhorrence of  me  should make  my  
      assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented by the same cause 
      from confiding in my cousin  and that there may be the 
      possibility of consulting him  i shall endeavour to find some 
      opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of 
      the morning  i will only add  god bless you  
 
         fitzwilliam darcy    
 
 
 
 
      chapter 36 
 
      if elizabeth  when mr  darcy gave her the letter  did not expect 
      it to contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no 
      expectation at all of its contents  but such as they were  it may 
      well be supposed how eagerly she went through them  and what a 
      contrariety of emotion they excited  her feelings as she read 
      were scarcely to be defined  with amazement did she first 
      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  and 
      steadfastly was she persuaded  that he could have no explanation 
      to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal  with a 
      strong prejudice against everything he might say  she began his 
      account of what had happened at netherfield  she read with an 
      eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension  and from 
      impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring  was 
      incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes  
      his belief of her sister   s insensibility she instantly resolved 
      to be false  and his account of the real  the worst objections to 
      the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him 
      justice  he expressed no regret for what he had done which 
      satisfied her  his style was not penitent  but haughty  it was 
      all pride and insolence  
 
      but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr  
      wickham   when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation 
      of events which  if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion 
      of his worth  and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own 
      history of himself   her feelings were yet more acutely painful and 
      more difficult of definition  astonishment  apprehension  and 
      even horror  oppressed her  she wished to discredit it entirely  
      repeatedly exclaiming     this must be false  this cannot be  this 
      must be the grossest falsehood       and when she had gone through 
      the whole letter  though scarcely knowing anything of the last 
      page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not 
      regard it  that she would never look in it again  
 
      in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on 
      nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the 
      letter was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she 
      could  she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related 
      to wickham  and commanded herself so far as to examine the 
      meaning of every sentence  the account of his connection with the 
      pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself  and the 
      kindness of the late mr  darcy  though she had not before known 
      its extent  agreed equally well with his own words  so far each 
      recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the will  the 
      difference was great  what wickham had said of the living was 
      fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was 
      impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side 
      or the other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that 
      her wishes did not err  but when she read and re-read with the 
      closest attention  the particulars immediately following of 
      wickham   s resigning all pretensions to the living  of his 
      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds  
      again was she forced to hesitate  she put down the letter  
      weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be 
      impartiality   deliberated on the probability of each statement   but 
      with little success  on both sides it was only assertion  again 
      she read on  but every line proved more clearly that the affair  
      which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could 
      so represent as to render mr  darcy   s conduct in it less than 
      infamous  was capable of a turn which must make him entirely 
      blameless throughout the whole  
 
      the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to 
      lay at mr  wickham   s charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more 
      so  as she could bring no proof of its injustice  she had never 
      heard of him before his entrance into the       shire militia  in 
      which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who  on 
      meeting him accidentally in town  had there renewed a slight 
      acquaintance  of his former way of life nothing had been known in 
      hertfordshire but what he told himself  as to his real character  
      had information been in her power  she had never felt a wish of 
      enquiring  his countenance  voice  and manner had established him 
      at once in the possession of every virtue  she tried to recollect 
      some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of integrity 
      or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of mr  
      darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for 
      those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what 
      mr  darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years    
      continuance  but no such recollection befriended her  she could 
      see him instantly before her  in every charm of air and address  
      but she could remember no more substantial good than the general 
      approbation of the neighbourhood  and the regard which his social 
      powers had gained him in the mess  after pausing on this point a 
      considerable while  she once more continued to read  but  alas  
      the story which followed  of his designs on miss darcy  received 
      some confirmation from what had passed between colonel 
      fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she 
      was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel 
      fitzwilliam himself   from whom she had previously received the 
      information of his near concern in all his cousin   s affairs  and 
      whose character she had no reason to question  at one time she 
      had almost resolved on applying to him  but the idea was checked 
      by the awkwardness of the application  and at length wholly 
      banished by the conviction that mr  darcy would never have 
      hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his 
      cousin   s corroboration  
 
      she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in 
      conversation between wickham and herself  in their first evening 
      at mr  phillips   s  many of his expressions were still fresh in 
      her memory  she was  now  struck with the impropriety of such 
      communications to a stranger  and wondered it had escaped her 
      before  she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he 
      had done  and the inconsistency of his professions with his 
      conduct  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of 
      seeing mr  darcy   that mr  darcy might leave the country  but that 
       he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield 
      ball the very next week  she remembered also that  till the 
      netherfield family had quitted the country  he had told his story 
      to no one but herself  but that after their removal it had been 
      everywhere discussed  that he had then no reserves  no scruples 
      in sinking mr  darcy   s character  though he had assured her that 
      respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son  
 
      how differently did everything now appear in which he was 
      concerned  his attentions to miss king were now the consequence 
      of views solely and hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of 
      her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes  but 
      his eagerness to grasp at anything  his behaviour to herself 
      could now have had no tolerable motive  he had either been 
      deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying his 
      vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had 
      most incautiously shown  every lingering struggle in his favour 
      grew fainter and fainter  and in farther justification of mr  
      darcy  she could not but allow that mr  bingley  when questioned 
      by jane  had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair  
      that proud and repulsive as were his manners  she had never  in 
      the whole course of their acquaintance   an acquaintance which had 
      latterly brought them much together  and given her a sort of 
      intimacy with his ways   seen anything that betrayed him to be 
      unprincipled or unjust   anything that spoke him of irreligious or 
      immoral habits  that among his own connections he was esteemed 
      and valued   that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother  
      and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his 
      sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling  that had 
      his actions been what mr  wickham represented them  so gross a 
      violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed 
      from the world  and that friendship between a person capable of 
      it  and such an amiable man as mr  bingley  was incomprehensible  
 
      she grew absolutely ashamed of herself  of neither darcy nor 
      wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind  
      partial  prejudiced  absurd  
 
         how despicably i have acted     she cried     i  who have prided 
      myself on my discernment  i  who have valued myself on my 
      abilities  who have often disdained the generous candour of my 
      sister  and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust  
      how humiliating is this discovery  yet  how just a humiliation  
      had i been in love  i could not have been more wretchedly blind  
      but vanity  not love  has been my folly  pleased with the 
      preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on 
      the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted 
      prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either 
      were concerned  till this moment i never knew myself     
 
      from herself to jane   from jane to bingley  her thoughts were in a 
      line which soon brought to her recollection that mr  darcy   s 
      explanation  there  had appeared very insufficient  and she read 
      it again  widely different was the effect of a second perusal  
      how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance  
      which she had been obliged to give in the other  he declared 
      himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister   s attachment  
      and she could not help remembering what charlotte   s opinion had 
      always been  neither could she deny the justice of his 
      description of jane  she felt that jane   s feelings  though 
      fervent  were little displayed  and that there was a constant 
      complacency in her air and manner not often united with great 
      sensibility  
 
      when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were 
      mentioned in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her 
      sense of shame was severe  the justice of the charge struck her 
      too forcibly for denial  and the circumstances to which he 
      particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball  
      and as confirming all his first disapprobation  could not have 
      made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers  
 
      the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt  it 
      soothed  but it could not console her for the contempt which had 
      thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family  and as she 
      considered that jane   s disappointment had in fact been the work 
      of her nearest relations  and reflected how materially the credit 
      of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct  she felt 
      depressed beyond anything she had ever known before  
 
      after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every 
      variety of thought   re-considering events  determining 
      probabilities  and reconciling herself  as well as she could  to 
      a change so sudden and so important  fatigue  and a recollection 
      of her long absence  made her at length return home  and she 
      entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual  
      and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make 
      her unfit for conversation  
 
      she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had 
      each called during her absence  mr  darcy  only for a few 
      minutes  to take leave   but that colonel fitzwilliam had been 
      sitting with them at least an hour  hoping for her return  and 
      almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found  
      elizabeth could but just  affect  concern in missing him  she 
      really rejoiced at it  colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an 
      object  she could think only of her letter  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 37 
 
      the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr  collins 
      having been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting 
      obeisance  was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of 
      their appearing in very good health  and in as tolerable spirits 
      as could be expected  after the melancholy scene so lately gone 
      through at rosings  to rosings he then hastened  to console lady 
      catherine and her daughter  and on his return brought back  with 
      great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship  importing that 
      she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having 
      them all to dine with her  
 
      elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that  
      had she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to 
      her as her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of 
      what her ladyship   s indignation would have been     what would she 
      have said  how would she have behaved     were questions with which 
      she amused herself  
 
      their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party     i 
      assure you  i feel it exceedingly     said lady catherine     i 
      believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do  but i 
      am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be 
      so much attached to me  they were excessively sorry to go  but so 
      they always are  the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably 
      till just at last  but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely  
      more  i think  than last year  his attachment to rosings 
      certainly increases     
 
      mr  collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here  
      which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter  
 
      lady catherine observed  after dinner  that miss bennet seemed 
      out of spirits  and immediately accounting for it herself  by 
      supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon  she 
      added  
 
         but if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg 
      that you may stay a little longer  mrs  collins will be very glad 
      of your company  i am sure     
 
         i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation     
      replied elizabeth     but it is not in my power to accept it  i 
      must be in town next saturday     
 
         why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  i 
      expected you to stay two months  i told mrs  collins so before 
      you came  there can be no occasion for your going so soon  mrs  
      bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight     
 
         but my father cannot  he wrote last week to hurry my return     
 
         oh  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can  
      daughters are never of so much consequence to a father  and if 
      you will stay another  month  complete  it will be in my power to 
      take one of you as far as london  for i am going there early in 
      june  for a week  and as dawson does not object to the 
      barouche-box  there will be very good room for one of you   and 
      indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i should not 
      object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large     
 
         you are all kindness  madam  but i believe we must abide by our 
      original plan     
 
      lady catherine seemed resigned     mrs  collins  you must send a 
      servant with them  you know i always speak my mind  and i cannot 
      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves  
      it is highly improper  you must contrive to send somebody  i have 
      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing  young 
      women should always be properly guarded and attended  according 
      to their situation in life  when my niece georgiana went to 
      ramsgate last summer  i made a point of her having two 
      men-servants go with her  miss darcy  the daughter of mr  darcy  
      of pemberley  and lady anne  could not have appeared with 
      propriety in a different manner  i am excessively attentive to 
      all those things  you must send john with the young ladies  mrs  
      collins  i am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would 
      really be discreditable to  you  to let them go alone     
 
         my uncle is to send a servant for us     
 
         oh  your uncle  he keeps a man-servant  does he  i am very glad 
      you have somebody who thinks of these things  where shall you 
      change horses  oh  bromley  of course  if you mention my name at 
      the bell  you will be attended to     
 
      lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their 
      journey  and as she did not answer them all herself  attention 
      was necessary  which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or  
      with a mind so occupied  she might have forgotten where she was  
      reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was 
      alone  she gave way to it as the greatest relief  and not a day 
      went by without a solitary walk  in which she might indulge in 
      all the delight of unpleasant recollections  
 
      mr  darcy   s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by 
      heart  she studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its 
      writer were at times widely different  when she remembered the 
      style of his address  she was still full of indignation  but when 
      she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him  
      her anger was turned against herself  and his disappointed 
      feelings became the object of compassion  his attachment excited 
      gratitude  his general character respect  but she could not 
      approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal  or 
      feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  in her own 
      past behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and 
      regret  and in the unhappy defects of her family  a subject of 
      yet heavier chagrin  they were hopeless of remedy  her father  
      contented with laughing at them  would never exert himself to 
      restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters  and her 
      mother  with manners so far from right herself  was entirely 
      insensible of the evil  elizabeth had frequently united with jane 
      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia  
      but while they were supported by their mother   s indulgence  what 
      chance could there be of improvement  catherine  weak-spirited  
      irritable  and completely under lydia   s guidance  had been always 
      affronted by their advice  and lydia  self-willed and careless  
      would scarcely give them a hearing  they were ignorant  idle  and 
      vain  while there was an officer in meryton  they would flirt 
      with him  and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn  they 
      would be going there forever  
 
      anxiety on jane   s behalf was another prevailing concern  and mr  
      darcy   s explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good 
      opinion  heightened the sense of what jane had lost  his 
      affection was proved to have been sincere  and his conduct 
      cleared of all blame  unless any could attach to the implicitness 
      of his confidence in his friend  how grievous then was the 
      thought that  of a situation so desirable in every respect  so 
      replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had been 
      deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family  
 
      when to these recollections was added the development of 
      wickham   s character  it may be easily believed that the happy 
      spirits which had seldom been depressed before  were now so much 
      affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear 
      tolerably cheerful  
 
      their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last 
      week of her stay as they had been at first  the very last evening 
      was spent there  and her ladyship again enquired minutely into 
      the particulars of their journey  gave them directions as to the 
      best method of packing  and was so urgent on the necessity of 
      placing gowns in the only right way  that maria thought herself 
      obliged  on her return  to undo all the work of the morning  and 
      pack her trunk afresh  
 
      when they parted  lady catherine  with great condescension  
      wished them a good journey  and invited them to come to hunsford 
      again next year  and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to 
      curtsey and hold out her hand to both  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 38 
 
      on saturday morning elizabeth and mr  collins met for breakfast a 
      few minutes before the others appeared  and he took the 
      opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed 
      indispensably necessary  
 
         i know not  miss elizabeth     said he     whether mrs  collins has 
      yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but i 
      am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving 
      her thanks for it  the favour of your company has been much felt  
      i assure you  we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our 
      humble abode  our plain manner of living  our small rooms and few 
      domestics  and the little we see of the world  must make hunsford 
      extremely dull to a young lady like yourself  but i hope you will 
      believe us grateful for the condescension  and that we have done 
      everything in our power to prevent your spending your time 
      unpleasantly     
 
      elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness  
      she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of 
      being with charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received  
      must make  her  feel the obliged  mr  collins was gratified  and 
      with a more smiling solemnity replied  
 
         it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your 
      time not disagreeably  we have certainly done our best  and most 
      fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very 
      superior society  and  from our connection with rosings  the 
      frequent means of varying the humble home scene  i think we may 
      flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been 
      entirely irksome  our situation with regard to lady catherine   s 
      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing 
      which few can boast  you see on what a footing we are  you see 
      how continually we are engaged there  in truth i must acknowledge 
      that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  i 
      should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion  
      while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings     
 
      words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he 
      was obliged to walk about the room  while elizabeth tried to 
      unite civility and truth in a few short sentences  
 
         you may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into 
      hertfordshire  my dear cousin  i flatter myself at least that you 
      will be able to do so  lady catherine   s great attentions to mrs  
      collins you have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust 
      it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate   but 
      on this point it will be as well to be silent  only let me assure 
      you  my dear miss elizabeth  that i can from my heart most 
      cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage  my dear charlotte 
      and i have but one mind and one way of thinking  there is in 
      everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas 
      between us  we seem to have been designed for each other     
 
      elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where 
      that was the case  and with equal sincerity could add  that she 
      firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  she was 
      not sorry  however  to have the recital of them interrupted by 
      the lady from whom they sprang  poor charlotte  it was melancholy 
      to leave her to such society  but she had chosen it with her eyes 
      open  and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to 
      go  she did not seem to ask for compassion  her home and her 
      housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their dependent 
      concerns  had not yet lost their charms  
 
      at length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the 
      parcels placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready  after 
      an affectionate parting between the friends  elizabeth was 
      attended to the carriage by mr  collins  and as they walked down 
      the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all 
      her family  not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had 
      received at longbourn in the winter  and his compliments to mr  
      and mrs  gardiner  though unknown  he then handed her in  maria 
      followed  and the door was on the point of being closed  when he 
      suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had 
      hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at 
      rosings  
 
         but     he added     you will of course wish to have your humble 
      respects delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their 
      kindness to you while you have been here     
 
      elizabeth made no objection  the door was then allowed to be 
      shut  and the carriage drove off  
 
         good gracious     cried maria  after a few minutes    silence     it 
      seems but a day or two since we first came  and yet how many 
      things have happened     
 
         a great many indeed     said her companion with a sigh  
 
         we have dined nine times at rosings  besides drinking tea there 
      twice  how much i shall have to tell     
 
      elizabeth added privately     and how much i shall have to 
      conceal     
 
      their journey was performed without much conversation  or any 
      alarm  and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they 
      reached mr  gardiner   s house  where they were to remain a few 
      days  
 
      jane looked well  and elizabeth had little opportunity of 
      studying her spirits  amidst the various engagements which the 
      kindness of her aunt had reserved for them  but jane was to go 
      home with her  and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for 
      observation  
 
      it was not without an effort  meanwhile  that she could wait even 
      for longbourn  before she told her sister of mr  darcy   s 
      proposals  to know that she had the power of revealing what would 
      so exceedingly astonish jane  and must  at the same time  so 
      highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been 
      able to reason away  was such a temptation to openness as nothing 
      could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she 
      remained as to the extent of what she should communicate  and her 
      fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried into 
      repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister 
      further  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 39 
 
      it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies 
      set out together from gracechurch street for the town of         in 
      hertfordshire  and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr  
      bennet   s carriage was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in 
      token of the coachman   s punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking 
      out of a dining-room up stairs  these two girls had been above an 
      hour in the place  happily employed in visiting an opposite 
      milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and dressing a salad 
      and cucumber  
 
      after welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a 
      table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually 
      affords  exclaiming     is not this nice  is not this an agreeable 
      surprise     
 
         and we mean to treat you all     added lydia     but you must lend 
      us the money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there     
      then  showing her purchases      look here  i have bought this 
      bonnet  i do not think it is very pretty  but i thought i might 
      as well buy it as not  i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get 
      home  and see if i can make it up any better     
 
      and when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect 
      unconcern     oh  but there were two or three much uglier in the 
      shop  and when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim 
      it with fresh  i think it will be very tolerable  besides  it 
      will not much signify what one wears this summer  after the 
            shire have left meryton  and they are going in a fortnight     
 
         are they indeed     cried elizabeth  with the greatest 
      satisfaction  
 
         they are going to be encamped near brighton  and i do so want 
      papa to take us all there for the summer  it would be such a 
      delicious scheme  and i dare say would hardly cost anything at 
      all  mamma would like to go too of all things  only think what a 
      miserable summer else we shall have     
 
         yes     thought elizabeth      that  would be a delightful scheme 
      indeed  and completely do for us at once  good heaven  brighton  
      and a whole campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset 
      already by one poor regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of 
      meryton     
 
         now i have got some news for you     said lydia  as they sat down 
      at table     what do you think  it is excellent news   capital 
      news   and about a certain person we all like     
 
      jane and elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told 
      he need not stay  lydia laughed  and said  
 
         aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  you 
      thought the waiter must not hear  as if he cared  i dare say he 
      often hears worse things said than i am going to say  but he is 
      an ugly fellow  i am glad he is gone  i never saw such a long 
      chin in my life  well  but now for my news  it is about dear 
      wickham  too good for the waiter  is it not  there is no danger 
      of wickham   s marrying mary king  there   s for you  she is gone 
      down to her uncle at liverpool  gone to stay  wickham is safe     
 
         and mary king is safe     added elizabeth     safe from a connection 
      imprudent as to fortune     
 
         she is a great fool for going away  if she liked him     
 
         but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side     said 
      jane  
 
         i am sure there is not on  his   i will answer for it  he never 
      cared three straws about her   who  could  about such a nasty 
      little freckled thing     
 
      elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such 
      coarseness of  expression  herself  the coarseness of the 
       sentiment  was little other than her own breast had harboured 
      and fancied liberal  
 
      as soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was 
      ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all 
      their boxes  work-bags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition 
      of kitty   s and lydia   s purchases  were seated in it  
 
         how nicely we are all crammed in     cried lydia     i am glad i 
      bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another 
      bandbox  well  now let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk 
      and laugh all the way home  and in the first place  let us hear 
      what has happened to you all since you went away  have you seen 
      any pleasant men  have you had any flirting  i was in great hopes 
      that one of you would have got a husband before you came back  
      jane will be quite an old maid soon  i declare  she is almost 
      three-and-twenty  lord  how ashamed i should be of not being 
      married before three-and-twenty  my aunt phillips wants you so to 
      get husbands  you can   t think  she says lizzy had better have 
      taken mr  collins  but  i  do not think there would have been any 
      fun in it  lord  how i should like to be married before any of 
      you  and then i would  chaperon  you about to all the balls  dear 
      me  we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel 
      forster   s  kitty and me were to spend the day there  and mrs  
      forster promised to have a little dance in the evening   by the 
      bye  mrs  forster and me are  such  friends   and so she asked 
      the two harringtons to come  but harriet was ill  and so pen was 
      forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did  we 
      dressed up chamberlayne in woman   s clothes on purpose to pass for 
      a lady  only think what fun  not a soul knew of it  but colonel 
      and mrs  forster  and kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were 
      forced to borrow one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how 
      well he looked  when denny  and wickham  and pratt  and two or 
      three more of the men came in  they did not know him in the 
      least  lord  how i laughed  and so did mrs  forster  i thought i 
      should have died  and  that  made the men suspect something  and 
      then they soon found out what was the matter     
 
      with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes  did 
      lydia  assisted by kitty   s hints and additions  endeavour to 
      amuse her companions all the way to longbourn  elizabeth listened 
      as little as she could  but there was no escaping the frequent 
      mention of wickham   s name  
 
      their reception at home was most kind  mrs  bennet rejoiced to 
      see jane in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner 
      did mr  bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth  
 
         i am glad you are come back  lizzy     
 
      their party in the dining-room was large  for almost all the 
      lucases came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were 
      the subjects that occupied them  lady lucas was enquiring of 
      maria  after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  mrs  
      bennet was doubly engaged  on one hand collecting an account of 
      the present fashions from jane  who sat some way below her  and  
      on the other  retailing them all to the younger lucases  and 
      lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person   s  was 
      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who 
      would hear her  
 
         oh  mary     said she     i wish you had gone with us  for we had 
      such fun  as we went along  kitty and i drew up the blinds  and 
      pretended there was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone 
      so all the way  if kitty had not been sick  and when we got to 
      the george  i do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated 
      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and 
      if you would have gone  we would have treated you too  and then 
      when we came away it was such fun  i thought we never should have 
      got into the coach  i was ready to die of laughter  and then we 
      were so merry all the way home  we talked and laughed so loud  
      that anybody might have heard us ten miles off     
 
      to this mary very gravely replied     far be it from me  my dear 
      sister  to depreciate such pleasures  they would doubtless be 
      congenial with the generality of female minds  but i confess they 
      would have no charms for  me    i should infinitely prefer a book     
 
      but of this answer lydia heard not a word  she seldom listened to 
      anybody for more than half a minute  and never attended to mary 
      at all  
 
      in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to 
      walk to meryton  and to see how everybody went on  but elizabeth 
      steadily opposed the scheme  it should not be said that the miss 
      bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in 
      pursuit of the officers  there was another reason too for her 
      opposition  she dreaded seeing mr  wickham again  and was 
      resolved to avoid it as long as possible  the comfort to  her  of 
      the regiment   s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression  
      in a fortnight they were to go   and once gone  she hoped there 
      could be nothing more to plague her on his account  
 
      she had not been many hours at home before she found that the 
      brighton scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn  
      was under frequent discussion between her parents  elizabeth saw 
      directly that her father had not the smallest intention of 
      yielding  but his answers were at the same time so vague and 
      equivocal  that her mother  though often disheartened  had never 
      yet despaired of succeeding at last  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 40 
 
      elizabeth   s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened 
      could no longer be overcome  and at length  resolving to suppress 
      every particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing 
      her to be surprised  she related to her the next morning the 
      chief of the scene between mr  darcy and herself  
 
      miss bennet   s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong 
      sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear 
      perfectly natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other 
      feelings  she was sorry that mr  darcy should have delivered his 
      sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  but 
      still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister   s 
      refusal must have given him  
 
         his being so sure of succeeding was wrong     said she     and 
      certainly ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it 
      must increase his disappointment     
 
         indeed     replied elizabeth     i am heartily sorry for him  but he 
      has other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his 
      regard for me  you do not blame me  however  for refusing him     
 
         blame you  oh  no     
 
         but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham     
 
         no   i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did     
 
         but you  will  know it  when i tell you what happened the very 
      next day     
 
      she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents 
      as far as they concerned george wickham  what a stroke was this 
      for poor jane  who would willingly have gone through the world 
      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole 
      race of mankind  as was here collected in one individual  nor was 
      darcy   s vindication  though grateful to her feelings  capable of 
      consoling her for such discovery  most earnestly did she labour 
      to prove the probability of error  and seek to clear the one 
      without involving the other  
 
         this will not do     said elizabeth     you never will be able to 
      make both of them good for anything  take your choice  but you 
      must be satisfied with only one  there is but such a quantity of 
      merit between them  just enough to make one good sort of man  and 
      of late it has been shifting about pretty much  for my part  i am 
      inclined to believe it all darcy   s  but you shall do as you 
      choose     
 
      it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from 
      jane  
 
         i do not know when i have been more shocked     said she     wickham 
      so very bad  it is almost past belief  and poor mr  darcy  dear 
      lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered  such a 
      disappointment  and with the knowledge of your ill opinion  too  
      and having to relate such a thing of his sister  it is really too 
      distressing  i am sure you must feel it so     
 
         oh  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you 
      so full of both  i know you will do him such ample justice  that 
      i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  your 
      profusion makes me saving  and if you lament over him much 
      longer  my heart will be as light as a feather     
 
         poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his 
      countenance  such an openness and gentleness in his manner     
 
         there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of 
      those two young men  one has got all the goodness  and the other 
      all the appearance of it     
 
         i never thought mr  darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it 
      as you used to do     
 
         and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a 
      dislike to him  without any reason  it is such a spur to one   s 
      genius  such an opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind  
      one may be continually abusive without saying anything just  but 
      one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then 
      stumbling on something witty     
 
         lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not 
      treat the matter as you do now     
 
         indeed  i could not  i was uncomfortable enough  i may say 
      unhappy  and with no one to speak to about what i felt  no jane 
      to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain 
      and nonsensical as i knew i had  oh  how i wanted you     
 
         how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong 
      expressions in speaking of wickham to mr  darcy  for now they 
       do  appear wholly undeserved     
 
         certainly  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a 
      most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been 
      encouraging  there is one point on which i want your advice  i 
      want to be told whether i ought  or ought not  to make our 
      acquaintances in general understand wickham   s character     
 
      miss bennet paused a little  and then replied     surely there can 
      be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  what is your 
      opinion     
 
         that it ought not to be attempted  mr  darcy has not authorised 
      me to make his communication public  on the contrary  every 
      particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as 
      possible to myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to 
      the rest of his conduct  who will believe me  the general 
      prejudice against mr  darcy is so violent  that it would be the 
      death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him 
      in an amiable light  i am not equal to it  wickham will soon be 
      gone  and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he 
      really is  some time hence it will be all found out  and then we 
      may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  at present 
      i will say nothing about it     
 
         you are quite right  to have his errors made public might ruin 
      him for ever  he is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and 
      anxious to re-establish a character  we must not make him 
      desperate     
 
      the tumult of elizabeth   s mind was allayed by this conversation  
      she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her 
      for a fortnight  and was certain of a willing listener in jane  
      whenever she might wish to talk again of either  but there was 
      still something lurking behind  of which prudence forbade the 
      disclosure  she dared not relate the other half of mr  darcy   s 
      letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been 
      valued by her friend  here was knowledge in which no one could 
      partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect 
      understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing 
      off this last encumbrance of mystery     and then     said she     if 
      that very improbable event should ever take place  i shall merely 
      be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable 
      manner himself  the liberty of communication cannot be mine till 
      it has lost all its value     
 
      she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the 
      real state of her sister   s spirits  jane was not happy  she still 
      cherished a very tender affection for bingley  having never even 
      fancied herself in love before  her regard had all the warmth of 
      first attachment  and  from her age and disposition  greater 
      steadiness than most first attachments often boast  and so 
      fervently did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every 
      other man  that all her good sense  and all her attention to the 
      feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the indulgence 
      of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health 
      and their tranquillity  
 
         well  lizzy     said mrs  bennet one day     what is your opinion 
       now  of this sad business of jane   s  for my part  i am 
      determined never to speak of it again to anybody  i told my 
      sister phillips so the other day  but i cannot find out that jane 
      saw anything of him in london  well  he is a very undeserving 
      young man   and i do not suppose there   s the least chance in the 
      world of her ever getting him now  there is no talk of his coming 
      to netherfield again in the summer  and i have enquired of 
      everybody  too  who is likely to know     
 
         i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more     
 
         oh well  it is just as he chooses  nobody wants him to come  
      though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill  and 
      if i was her  i would not have put up with it  well  my comfort 
      is  i am sure jane will die of a broken heart  and then he will 
      be sorry for what he has done     
 
      but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such 
      expectation  she made no answer  
 
         well  lizzy     continued her mother  soon afterwards     and so the 
      collinses live very comfortable  do they  well  well  i only hope 
      it will last  and what sort of table do they keep  charlotte is 
      an excellent manager  i dare say  if she is half as sharp as her 
      mother  she is saving enough  there is nothing extravagant in 
       their  housekeeping  i dare say     
 
         no  nothing at all     
 
         a great deal of good management  depend upon it  yes  yes  
       they  will take care not to outrun their income   they  will 
      never be distressed for money  well  much good may it do them  
      and so  i suppose  they often talk of having longbourn when your 
      father is dead  they look upon it as quite their own  i dare say  
      whenever that happens     
 
         it was a subject which they could not mention before me     
 
         no  it would have been strange if they had  but i make no doubt 
      they often talk of it between themselves  well  if they can be 
      easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the 
      better   i  should be ashamed of having one that was only 
      entailed on me     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 41 
 
      the first week of their return was soon gone  the second began  
      it was the last of the regiment   s stay in meryton  and all the 
      young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  the 
      dejection was almost universal  the elder miss bennets alone were 
      still able to eat  drink  and sleep  and pursue the usual course 
      of their employments  very frequently were they reproached for 
      this insensibility by kitty and lydia  whose own misery was 
      extreme  and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in 
      any of the family  
 
         good heaven  what is to become of us  what are we to do     would 
      they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe     how can you be 
      smiling so  lizzy     
 
      their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered 
      what she had herself endured on a similar occasion  
      five-and-twenty years ago  
 
         i am sure     said she     i cried for two days together when 
      colonel miller   s regiment went away  i thought i should have 
      broken my heart     
 
         i am sure i shall break  mine      said lydia  
 
         if one could but go to brighton     observed mrs  bennet  
 
         oh  yes    if one could but go to brighton  but papa is so 
      disagreeable     
 
         a little sea-bathing would set me up forever     
 
         and my aunt phillips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of 
      good     added kitty  
 
      such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through 
      longbourn house  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all 
      sense of pleasure was lost in shame  she felt anew the justice of 
      mr  darcy   s objections  and never had she been so much disposed 
      to pardon his interference in the views of his friend  
 
      but the gloom of lydia   s prospect was shortly cleared away  for 
      she received an invitation from mrs  forster  the wife of the 
      colonel of the regiment  to accompany her to brighton  this 
      invaluable friend was a very young woman  and very lately 
      married  a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had 
      recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of their  three  
      months    acquaintance they had been intimate  two   
 
      the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mrs  
      forster  the delight of mrs  bennet  and the mortification of 
      kitty  are scarcely to be described  wholly inattentive to her 
      sister   s feelings  lydia flew about the house in restless 
      ecstasy  calling for everyone   s congratulations  and laughing and 
      talking with more violence than ever  whilst the luckless kitty 
      continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as 
      unreasonable as her accent was peevish  
 
         i cannot see why mrs  forster should not ask  me  as well as 
      lydia     said she     though i am  not  her particular friend  i 
      have just as much right to be asked as she has  and more too  for 
      i am two years older     
 
      in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to 
      make her resigned  as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was 
      so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother 
      and lydia  that she considered it as the death warrant of all 
      possibility of common sense for the latter  and detestable as 
      such a step must make her were it known  she could not help 
      secretly advising her father not to let her go  she represented 
      to him all the improprieties of lydia   s general behaviour  the 
      little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a 
      woman as mrs  forster  and the probability of her being yet more 
      imprudent with such a companion at brighton  where the 
      temptations must be greater than at home  he heard her 
      attentively  and then said  
 
         lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some 
      public place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with 
      so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the 
      present circumstances     
 
         if you were aware     said elizabeth     of the very great 
      disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of 
      lydia   s unguarded and imprudent manner   nay  which has already 
      arisen from it  i am sure you would judge differently in the 
      affair     
 
         already arisen     repeated mr  bennet     what  has she frightened 
      away some of your lovers  poor little lizzy  but do not be cast 
      down  such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a 
      little absurdity are not worth a regret  come  let me see the 
      list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia   s 
      folly     
 
         indeed you are mistaken  i have no such injuries to resent  it 
      is not of particular  but of general evils  which i am now 
      complaining  our importance  our respectability in the world must 
      be affected by the wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of 
      all restraint which mark lydia   s character  excuse me  for i must 
      speak plainly  if you  my dear father  will not take the trouble 
      of checking her exuberant spirits  and of teaching her that her 
      present pursuits are not to be the business of her life  she will 
      soon be beyond the reach of amendment  her character will be 
      fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt 
      that ever made herself or her family ridiculous  a flirt  too  in 
      the worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any 
      attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person  and  from the 
      ignorance and emptiness of her mind  wholly unable to ward off 
      any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for 
      admiration will excite  in this danger kitty also is 
      comprehended  she will follow wherever lydia leads  vain  
      ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled  oh  my dear father  
      can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and 
      despised wherever they are known  and that their sisters will not 
      be often involved in the disgrace     
 
      mr  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and 
      affectionately taking her hand said in reply  
 
         do not make yourself uneasy  my love  wherever you and jane are 
      known you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear 
      to less advantage for having a couple of   or i may say  three   very 
      silly sisters  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does 
      not go to brighton  let her go  then  colonel forster is a 
      sensible man  and will keep her out of any real mischief  and she 
      is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody  at 
      brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt 
      than she has been here  the officers will find women better worth 
      their notice  let us hope  therefore  that her being there may 
      teach her her own insignificance  at any rate  she cannot grow 
      many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the 
      rest of her life     
 
      with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own 
      opinion continued the same  and she left him disappointed and 
      sorry  it was not in her nature  however  to increase her 
      vexations by dwelling on them  she was confident of having 
      performed her duty  and to fret over unavoidable evils  or 
      augment them by anxiety  was no part of her disposition  
 
      had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference 
      with her father  their indignation would hardly have found 
      expression in their united volubility  in lydia   s imagination  a 
      visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly 
      happiness  she saw  with the creative eye of fancy  the streets 
      of that gay bathing-place covered with officers  she saw herself 
      the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them at present 
      unknown  she saw all the glories of the camp   its tents stretched 
      forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young 
      and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and  to complete the 
      view  she saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting 
      with at least six officers at once  
 
      had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects 
      and such realities as these  what would have been her sensations  
      they could have been understood only by her mother  who might 
      have felt nearly the same  lydia   s going to brighton was all that 
      consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband   s never 
      intending to go there himself  
 
      but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their 
      raptures continued  with little intermission  to the very day of 
      lydia   s leaving home  
 
      elizabeth was now to see mr  wickham for the last time  having 
      been frequently in company with him since her return  agitation 
      was pretty well over  the agitations of former partiality 
      entirely so  she had even learnt to detect  in the very 
      gentleness which had first delighted her  an affectation and a 
      sameness to disgust and weary  in his present behaviour to 
      herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure  for the 
      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which 
      had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve  
      after what had since passed  to provoke her  she lost all concern 
      for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such 
      idle and frivolous gallantry  and while she steadily repressed 
      it  could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing  
      that however long  and for whatever cause  his attentions had 
      been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified  and her preference 
      secured at any time by their renewal  
 
      on the very last day of the regiment   s remaining at meryton  he 
      dined  with others of the officers  at longbourn  and so little 
      was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour  that on 
      his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had 
      passed at hunsford  she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam   s and mr  
      darcy   s having both spent three weeks at rosings  and asked him  
      if he was acquainted with the former  
 
      he looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment   s 
      recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly 
      seen him often  and  after observing that he was a very 
      gentlemanlike man  asked her how she had liked him  her answer 
      was warmly in his favour  with an air of indifference he soon 
      afterwards added  
 
         how long did you say he was at rosings     
 
         nearly three weeks     
 
         and you saw him frequently     
 
         yes  almost every day     
 
         his manners are very different from his cousin   s     
 
         yes  very different  but i think mr  darcy improves upon 
      acquaintance     
 
         indeed     cried mr  wickham with a look which did not escape her  
         and pray  may i ask        but checking himself  he added  in a 
      gayer tone     is it in address that he improves  has he deigned to 
      add aught of civility to his ordinary style    for i dare not 
      hope     he continued in a lower and more serious tone     that he is 
      improved in essentials     
 
         oh  no     said elizabeth     in essentials  i believe  he is very 
      much what he ever was     
 
      while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to 
      rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning  there was a 
      something in her countenance which made him listen with an 
      apprehensive and anxious attention  while she added  
 
         when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean 
      that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but 
      that  from knowing him better  his disposition was better 
      understood     
 
      wickham   s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and 
      agitated look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off 
      his embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the 
      gentlest of accents  
 
         you  who so well know my feeling towards mr  darcy  will readily 
      comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to 
      assume even the  appearance  of what is right  his pride  in that 
      direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  
      for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have 
      suffered by  i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which 
      you  i imagine  have been alluding  is merely adopted on his 
      visits to his aunt  of whose good opinion and judgement he stands 
      much in awe  his fear of her has always operated  i know  when 
      they were together  and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish 
      of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh  which i am certain 
      he has very much at heart     
 
      elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered 
      only by a slight inclination of the head  she saw that he wanted 
      to engage her on the old subject of his grievances  and she was 
      in no humour to indulge him  the rest of the evening passed with 
      the  appearance   on his side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no 
      further attempt to distinguish elizabeth  and they parted at last 
      with mutual civility  and possibly a mutual desire of never 
      meeting again  
 
      when the party broke up  lydia returned with mrs  forster to 
      meryton  from whence they were to set out early the next morning  
      the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than 
      pathetic  kitty was the only one who shed tears  but she did weep 
      from vexation and envy  mrs  bennet was diffuse in her good 
      wishes for the felicity of her daughter  and impressive in her 
      injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying 
      herself as much as possible   advice which there was every reason 
      to believe would be well attended to  and in the clamorous 
      happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more gentle 
      adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 42 
 
      had elizabeth   s opinion been all drawn from her own family  she 
      could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal 
      felicity or domestic comfort  her father  captivated by youth and 
      beauty  and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty 
      generally give  had married a woman whose weak understanding and 
      illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all 
      real affection for her  respect  esteem  and confidence had 
      vanished for ever  and all his views of domestic happiness were 
      overthrown  but mr  bennet was not of a disposition to seek 
      comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had 
      brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often console the 
      unfortunate for their folly or their vice  he was fond of the 
      country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his 
      principal enjoyments  to his wife he was very little otherwise 
      indebted  than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his 
      amusement  this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in 
      general wish to owe to his wife  but where other powers of 
      entertainment are wanting  the true philosopher will derive 
      benefit from such as are given  
 
      elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of 
      her father   s behaviour as a husband  she had always seen it with 
      pain  but respecting his abilities  and grateful for his 
      affectionate treatment of herself  she endeavoured to forget what 
      she could not overlook  and to banish from her thoughts that 
      continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which  in 
      exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children  was so 
      highly reprehensible  but she had never felt so strongly as now 
      the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable 
      a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising 
      from so ill-judged a direction of talents  talents  which  
      rightly used  might at least have preserved the respectability of 
      his daughters  even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his 
      wife  
 
      when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham   s departure she found 
      little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment  
      their parties abroad were less varied than before  and at home 
      she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the 
      dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their 
      domestic circle  and  though kitty might in time regain her 
      natural degree of sense  since the disturbers of her brain were 
      removed  her other sister  from whose disposition greater evil 
      might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all her folly 
      and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a 
      watering-place and a camp  upon the whole  therefore  she found  
      what has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she 
      had looked forward with impatient desire did not  in taking 
      place  bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself  it 
      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the 
      commencement of actual felicity   to have some other point on which 
      her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by again enjoying the 
      pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the present  and 
      prepare for another disappointment  her tour to the lakes was now 
      the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation 
      for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her 
      mother and kitty made inevitable  and could she have included 
      jane in the scheme  every part of it would have been perfect  
 
         but it is fortunate     thought she     that i have something to 
      wish for  were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment 
      would be certain  but here  by carrying with me one ceaseless 
      source of regret in my sister   s absence  i may reasonably hope to 
      have all my expectations of pleasure realised  a scheme of which 
      every part promises delight can never be successful  and general 
      disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little 
      peculiar vexation     
 
      when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very 
      minutely to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always 
      long expected  and always very short  those to her mother 
      contained little else than that they were just returned from the 
      library  where such and such officers had attended them  and 
      where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite 
      wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which she would 
      have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a 
      violent hurry  as mrs  forster called her  and they were going 
      off to the camp  and from her correspondence with her sister  
      there was still less to be learnt   for her letters to kitty  
      though rather longer  were much too full of lines under the words 
      to be made public  
 
      after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health  
      good humour  and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn  
      everything wore a happier aspect  the families who had been in 
      town for the winter came back again  and summer finery and summer 
      engagements arose  mrs  bennet was restored to her usual 
      querulous serenity  and  by the middle of june  kitty was so much 
      recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears  an event 
      of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the 
      following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not 
      to mention an officer above once a day  unless  by some cruel and 
      malicious arrangement at the war office  another regiment should 
      be quartered in meryton  
 
      the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now 
      fast approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a 
      letter arrived from mrs  gardiner  which at once delayed its 
      commencement and curtailed its extent  mr  gardiner would be 
      prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in 
      july  and must be in london again within a month  and as that 
      left too short a period for them to go so far  and see so much as 
      they had proposed  or at least to see it with the leisure and 
      comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up the 
      lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to 
      the present plan  were to go no farther northwards than 
      derbyshire  in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy 
      the chief of their three weeks  and to mrs  gardiner it had a 
      peculiarly strong attraction  the town where she had formerly 
      passed some years of her life  and where they were now to spend a 
      few days  was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all 
      the celebrated beauties of matlock  chatsworth  dovedale  or the 
      peak  
 
      elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on 
      seeing the lakes  and still thought there might have been time 
      enough  but it was her business to be satisfied   and certainly her 
      temper to be happy  and all was soon right again  
 
      with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected  
      it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of 
      pemberley and its owner     but surely     said she     i may enter his 
      county with impunity  and rob it of a few petrified spars without 
      his perceiving me     
 
      the period of expectation was now doubled  four weeks were to 
      pass away before her uncle and aunt   s arrival  but they did pass 
      away  and mr  and mrs  gardiner  with their four children  did at 
      length appear at longbourn  the children  two girls of six and 
      eight years old  and two younger boys  were to be left under the 
      particular care of their cousin jane  who was the general 
      favourite  and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly 
      adapted her for attending to them in every way   teaching them  
      playing with them  and loving them  
 
      the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn  and set off the 
      next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement  
      one enjoyment was certain   that of suitableness of companions  a 
      suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear 
      inconveniences   cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure   and 
      affection and intelligence  which might supply it among 
      themselves if there were disappointments abroad  
 
      it is not the object of this work to give a description of 
      derbyshire  nor of any of the remarkable places through which 
      their route thither lay  oxford  blenheim  warwick  kenilworth  
      birmingham  etc  are sufficiently known  a small part of 
      derbyshire is all the present concern  to the little town of 
      lambton  the scene of mrs  gardiner   s former residence  and where 
      she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained  they 
      bent their steps  after having seen all the principal wonders of 
      the country  and within five miles of lambton  elizabeth found 
      from her aunt that pemberley was situated  it was not in their 
      direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it  in talking 
      over their route the evening before  mrs  gardiner expressed an 
      inclination to see the place again  mr  gardiner declared his 
      willingness  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation  
 
         my love  should not you like to see a place of which you have 
      heard so much     said her aunt     a place  too  with which so many 
      of your acquaintances are connected  wickham passed all his youth 
      there  you know     
 
      elizabeth was distressed  she felt that she had no business at 
      pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing 
      it  she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses  after 
      going over so many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or 
      satin curtains  
 
      mrs  gardiner abused her stupidity     if it were merely a fine 
      house richly furnished     said she     i should not care about it 
      myself  but the grounds are delightful  they have some of the 
      finest woods in the country     
 
      elizabeth said no more   but her mind could not acquiesce  the 
      possibility of meeting mr  darcy  while viewing the place  
      instantly occurred  it would be dreadful  she blushed at the very 
      idea  and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt 
      than to run such a risk  but against this there were objections  
      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource  if 
      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were 
      unfavourably answered  
 
      accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid 
      whether pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name 
      of its proprietor  and  with no little alarm  whether the family 
      were down for the summer  a most welcome negative followed the 
      last question   and her alarms now being removed  she was at 
      leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house 
      herself  and when the subject was revived the next morning  and 
      she was again applied to  could readily answer  and with a proper 
      air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike to the 
      scheme  to pemberley  therefore  they were to go  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 43 
 
      elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance 
      of pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length 
      they turned in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter  
 
      the park was very large  and contained great variety of ground  
      they entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some 
      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent  
 
      elizabeth   s mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and 
      admired every remarkable spot and point of view  they gradually 
      ascended for half-a-mile  and then found themselves at the top of 
      a considerable eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was 
      instantly caught by pemberley house  situated on the opposite 
      side of a valley  into which the road with some abruptness wound  
      it was a large  handsome stone building  standing well on rising 
      ground  and backed by a ridge of high woody hills  and in front  
      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater  but 
      without any artificial appearance  its banks were neither formal 
      nor falsely adorned  elizabeth was delighted  she had never seen 
      a place for which nature had done more  or where natural beauty 
      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  they were 
      all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt 
      that to be mistress of pemberley might be something  
 
      they descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the 
      door  and  while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all 
      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned  she dreaded lest 
      the chambermaid had been mistaken  on applying to see the place  
      they were admitted into the hall  and elizabeth  as they waited 
      for the housekeeper  had leisure to wonder at her being where she 
      was  
 
      the housekeeper came  a respectable-looking elderly woman  much 
      less fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding 
      her  they followed her into the dining-parlour  it was a large  
      well proportioned room  handsomely fitted up  elizabeth  after 
      slightly surveying it  went to a window to enjoy its prospect  
      the hill  crowned with wood  which they had descended  receiving 
      increased abruptness from the distance  was a beautiful object  
      every disposition of the ground was good  and she looked on the 
      whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its banks and the 
      winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it  with 
      delight  as they passed into other rooms these objects were 
      taking different positions  but from every window there were 
      beauties to be seen  the rooms were lofty and handsome  and their 
      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor  but 
      elizabeth saw  with admiration of his taste  that it was neither 
      gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of splendour  and more real 
      elegance  than the furniture of rosings  
 
         and of this place     thought she     i might have been mistress  
      with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted  
      instead of viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in 
      them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and 
      aunt  but no       recollecting herself      that could never be  my 
      uncle and aunt would have been lost to me  i should not have been 
      allowed to invite them     
 
      this was a lucky recollection   it saved her from something very 
      like regret  
 
      she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was 
      really absent  but had not the courage for it  at length however  
      the question was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with 
      alarm  while mrs  reynolds replied that he was  adding     but we 
      expect him to-morrow  with a large party of friends     how 
      rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any 
      circumstance been delayed a day  
 
      her aunt now called her to look at a picture  she approached and 
      saw the likeness of mr  wickham  suspended  amongst several other 
      miniatures  over the mantelpiece  her aunt asked her  smilingly  
      how she liked it  the housekeeper came forward  and told them it 
      was a picture of a young gentleman  the son of her late master   s 
      steward  who had been brought up by him at his own expense     he 
      is now gone into the army     she added     but i am afraid he has 
      turned out very wild     
 
      mrs  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth 
      could not return it  
 
         and that     said mrs  reynolds  pointing to another of the 
      miniatures     is my master   and very like him  it was drawn at the 
      same time as the other   about eight years ago     
 
         i have heard much of your master   s fine person     said mrs  
      gardiner  looking at the picture     it is a handsome face  but  
      lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not     
 
      mrs  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this 
      intimation of her knowing her master  
 
         does that young lady know mr  darcy     
 
      elizabeth coloured  and said     a little     
 
         and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma   am     
 
         yes  very handsome     
 
         i am sure  i  know none so handsome  but in the gallery up 
      stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this  
      this room was my late master   s favourite room  and these 
      miniatures are just as they used to be then  he was very fond of 
      them     
 
      this accounted to elizabeth for mr  wickham   s being among them  
 
      mrs  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy  
      drawn when she was only eight years old  
 
         and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother     said mrs  
      gardiner  
 
         oh  yes   the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so 
      accomplished    she plays and sings all day long  in the next room 
      is a new instrument just come down for her   a present from my 
      master  she comes here to-morrow with him     
 
      mr  gardiner  whose manners were very easy and pleasant  
      encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks  
      mrs  reynolds  either by pride or attachment  had evidently great 
      pleasure in talking of her master and his sister  
 
         is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year     
 
         not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend 
      half his time here  and miss darcy is always down for the summer 
      months     
 
         except     thought elizabeth     when she goes to ramsgate     
 
         if your master would marry  you might see more of him     
 
         yes  sir  but i do not know when  that  will be  i do not know 
      who is good enough for him     
 
      mr  and mrs  gardiner smiled  elizabeth could not help saying  
         it is very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think 
      so     
 
         i say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows 
      him     replied the other  elizabeth thought this was going pretty 
      far  and she listened with increasing astonishment as the 
      housekeeper added     i have never known a cross word from him in 
      my life  and i have known him ever since he was four years old     
 
      this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite 
      to her ideas  that he was not a good-tempered man had been her 
      firmest opinion  her keenest attention was awakened  she longed 
      to hear more  and was grateful to her uncle for saying  
 
         there are very few people of whom so much can be said  you are 
      lucky in having such a master     
 
         yes  sir  i know i am  if i were to go through the world  i 
      could not meet with a better  but i have always observed  that 
      they who are good-natured when children  are good-natured when 
      they grow up  and he was always the sweetest-tempered  most 
      generous-hearted boy in the world     
 
      elizabeth almost stared at her     can this be mr  darcy     thought 
      she  
 
         his father was an excellent man     said mrs  gardiner  
 
         yes  ma   am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like 
      him   just as affable to the poor     
 
      elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for 
      more  mrs  reynolds could interest her on no other point  she 
      related the subjects of the pictures  the dimensions of the 
      rooms  and the price of the furniture  in vain  mr  gardiner  
      highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he 
      attributed her excessive commendation of her master  soon led 
      again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his many 
      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase  
 
         he is the best landlord  and the best master     said she     that 
      ever lived  not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of 
      nothing but themselves  there is not one of his tenants or 
      servants but will give him a good name  some people call him 
      proud  but i am sure i never saw anything of it  to my fancy  it 
      is only because he does not rattle away like other young men     
 
         in what an amiable light does this place him     thought 
      elizabeth  
 
         this fine account of him     whispered her aunt as they walked  
         is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend     
 
         perhaps we might be deceived     
 
         that is not very likely  our authority was too good     
 
      on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very 
      pretty sitting-room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and 
      lightness than the apartments below  and were informed that it 
      was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy  who had taken a 
      liking to the room when last at pemberley  
 
         he is certainly a good brother     said elizabeth  as she walked 
      towards one of the windows  
 
      mrs  reynolds anticipated miss darcy   s delight  when she should 
      enter the room     and this is always the way with him     she added  
         whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in 
      a moment  there is nothing he would not do for her     
 
      the picture-gallery  and two or three of the principal bedrooms  
      were all that remained to be shown  in the former were many good 
      paintings  but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such 
      as had been already visible below  she had willingly turned to 
      look at some drawings of miss darcy   s  in crayons  whose subjects 
      were usually more interesting  and also more intelligible  
 
      in the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could 
      have little to fix the attention of a stranger  elizabeth walked 
      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her  
      at last it arrested her   and she beheld a striking resemblance to 
      mr  darcy  with such a smile over the face as she remembered to 
      have sometimes seen when he looked at her  she stood several 
      minutes before the picture  in earnest contemplation  and 
      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery  mrs  
      reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father   s 
      lifetime  
 
      there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth   s mind  a more 
      gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at 
      the height of their acquaintance  the commendation bestowed on 
      him by mrs  reynolds was of no trifling nature  what praise is 
      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant  as a 
      brother  a landlord  a master  she considered how many people   s 
      happiness were in his guardianship    how much of pleasure or pain 
      was it in his power to bestow    how much of good or evil must be 
      done by him  every idea that had been brought forward by the 
      housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she stood 
      before the canvas on which he was represented  and fixed his eyes 
      upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment 
      of gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its 
      warmth  and softened its impropriety of expression  
 
      when all of the house that was open to general inspection had 
      been seen  they returned downstairs  and  taking leave of the 
      housekeeper  were consigned over to the gardener  who met them at 
      the hall-door  
 
      as they walked across the hall towards the river  elizabeth 
      turned back to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and 
      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building  
      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road  
      which led behind it to the stables  
 
      they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was 
      his appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight  their 
      eyes instantly met  and the cheeks of both were overspread with 
      the deepest blush  he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed 
      immovable from surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced 
      towards the party  and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of 
      perfect composure  at least of perfect civility  
 
      she had instinctively turned away  but stopping on his approach  
      received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be 
      overcome  had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the 
      picture they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure 
      the other two that they now saw mr  darcy  the gardener   s 
      expression of surprise  on beholding his master  must immediately 
      have told it  they stood a little aloof while he was talking to 
      their niece  who  astonished and confused  scarcely dared lift 
      her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer she returned to 
      his civil enquiries after her family  amazed at the alteration of 
      his manner since they last parted  every sentence that he uttered 
      was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the 
      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind  the 
      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most 
      uncomfortable in her life  nor did he seem much more at ease  
      when he spoke  his accent had none of its usual sedateness  and 
      he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left 
      longbourn  and of her stay in derbyshire  so often  and in so 
      hurried a way  as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts  
 
      at length every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a 
      few moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected 
      himself  and took leave  
 
      the others then joined her  and expressed admiration of his 
      figure  but elizabeth heard not a word  and wholly engrossed by 
      her own feelings  followed them in silence  she was overpowered 
      by shame and vexation  her coming there was the most unfortunate  
      the most ill-judged thing in the world  how strange it must 
      appear to him  in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so 
      vain a man  it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself 
      in his way again  oh  why did she come  or  why did he thus come 
      a day before he was expected  had they been only ten minutes 
      sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his 
      discrimination  for it was plain that he was that moment 
      arrived   that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage  she 
      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting  and 
      his behaviour  so strikingly altered   what could it mean  that he 
      should even speak to her was amazing    but to speak with such 
      civility  to enquire after her family  never in her life had she 
      seen his manners so little dignified  never had he spoken with 
      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  what a contrast 
      did it offer to his last address in rosings park  when he put his 
      letter into her hand  she knew not what to think  or how to 
      account for it  
 
      they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water  
      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a 
      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it 
      was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and  
      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her 
      uncle and aunt  and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as 
      they pointed out  she distinguished no part of the scene  her 
      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house  
      whichever it might be  where mr  darcy then was  she longed to 
      know what at the moment was passing in his mind   in what manner he 
      thought of her  and whether  in defiance of everything  she was 
      still dear to him  perhaps he had been civil only because he felt 
      himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice which was 
      not like ease  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in 
      seeing her she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her 
      with composure  
 
      at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence 
      of mind aroused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more 
      like herself  
 
      they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a 
      while  ascended some of the higher grounds  when  in spots where 
      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many 
      charming views of the valley  the opposite hills  with the long 
      range of woods overspreading many  and occasionally part of the 
      stream  mr  gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole 
      park  but feared it might be beyond a walk  with a triumphant 
      smile they were told that it was ten miles round  it settled the 
      matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which brought 
      them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods  to 
      the edge of the water  and one of its narrowest parts  they 
      crossed it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air 
      of the scene  it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet 
      visited  and the valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed 
      room only for the stream  and a narrow walk amidst the rough 
      coppice-wood which bordered it  elizabeth longed to explore its 
      windings  but when they had crossed the bridge  and perceived 
      their distance from the house  mrs  gardiner  who was not a great 
      walker  could go no farther  and thought only of returning to the 
      carriage as quickly as possible  her niece was  therefore  
      obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house on 
      the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but 
      their progress was slow  for mr  gardiner  though seldom able to 
      indulge the taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much 
      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in 
      the water  and talking to the man about them  that he advanced 
      but little  whilst wandering on in this slow manner  they were 
      again surprised  and elizabeth   s astonishment was quite equal to 
      what it had been at first  by the sight of mr  darcy approaching 
      them  and at no great distance  the walk being here less 
      sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before 
      they met  elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more 
      prepared for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and 
      to speak with calmness  if he really intended to meet them  for a 
      few moments  indeed  she felt that he would probably strike into 
      some other path  the idea lasted while a turning in the walk 
      concealed him from their view  the turning past  he was 
      immediately before them  with a glance  she saw that he had lost 
      none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his politeness  she 
      began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place  but she 
      had not got beyond the words    delightful     and    charming     when 
      some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise 
      of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed  her 
      colour changed  and she said no more  
 
      mrs  gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing  
      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to 
      her friends  this was a stroke of civility for which she was 
      quite unprepared  and she could hardly suppress a smile at his 
      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people 
      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself  
         what will be his surprise     thought she     when he knows who they 
      are  he takes them now for people of fashion     
 
      the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named 
      their relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to 
      see how he bore it  and was not without the expectation of his 
      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions  
      that he was  surprised  by the connection was evident  he 
      sustained it  however  with fortitude  and so far from going 
      away  turned back with them  and entered into conversation with 
      mr  gardiner  elizabeth could not but be pleased  could not but 
      triumph  it was consoling that he should know she had some 
      relations for whom there was no need to blush  she listened most 
      attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every 
      expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his 
      intelligence  his taste  or his good manners  
 
      the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr  
      darcy invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as 
      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood  
      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle  and 
      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually 
      most sport  mrs  gardiner  who was walking arm-in-arm with 
      elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of wonder  elizabeth said 
      nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment must be 
      all for herself  her astonishment  however  was extreme  and 
      continually was she repeating     why is he so altered  from what 
      can it proceed  it cannot be for  me    it cannot be for  my  sake 
      that his manners are thus softened  my reproofs at hunsford could 
      not work such a change as this  it is impossible that he should 
      still love me     
 
      after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the 
      two gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending 
      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some 
      curious water-plant  there chanced to be a little alteration  it 
      originated in mrs  gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the 
      morning  found elizabeth   s arm inadequate to her support  and 
      consequently preferred her husband   s  mr  darcy took her place by 
      her niece  and they walked on together  after a short silence  
      the lady first spoke  she wished him to know that she had been 
      assured of his absence before she came to the place  and 
      accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been very 
      unexpected      for your housekeeper     she added     informed us that 
      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow  and indeed  
      before we left bakewell  we understood that you were not 
      immediately expected in the country     he acknowledged the truth 
      of it all  and said that business with his steward had occasioned 
      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with 
      whom he had been travelling     they will join me early to-morrow     
      he continued     and among them are some who will claim an 
      acquaintance with you   mr  bingley and his sisters     
 
      elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  her thoughts were 
      instantly driven back to the time when mr  bingley   s name had 
      been the last mentioned between them  and  if she might judge by 
      his complexion   his  mind was not very differently engaged  
 
         there is also one other person in the party     he continued after 
      a pause     who more particularly wishes to be known to you  will 
      you allow me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to 
      your acquaintance during your stay at lambton     
 
      the surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too 
      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  she 
      immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of 
      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother  and  
      without looking farther  it was satisfactory  it was gratifying 
      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of 
      her  
 
      they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought  
      elizabeth was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was 
      flattered and pleased  his wish of introducing his sister to her 
      was a compliment of the highest kind  they soon outstripped the 
      others  and when they had reached the carriage  mr  and mrs  
      gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind  
 
      he then asked her to walk into the house   but she declared herself 
      not tired  and they stood together on the lawn  at such a time 
      much might have been said  and silence was very awkward  she 
      wanted to talk  but there seemed to be an embargo on every 
      subject  at last she recollected that she had been travelling  
      and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance  
      yet time and her aunt moved slowly   and her patience and her ideas 
      were nearly worn out before the  t  te-  -t  te  was over  
 
      on mr  and mrs  gardiner   s coming up they were all pressed to go 
      into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined  
      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness  mr  darcy 
      handed the ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off  
      elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house  
 
      the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of 
      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they 
      had expected     he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and 
      unassuming     said her uncle  
 
         there  is  something a little stately in him  to be sure     
      replied her aunt     but it is confined to his air  and is not 
      unbecoming  i can now say with the housekeeper  that though some 
      people may call him proud   i  have seen nothing of it     
 
         i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  it was 
      more than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no 
      necessity for such attention  his acquaintance with elizabeth was 
      very trifling     
 
         to be sure  lizzy     said her aunt     he is not so handsome as 
      wickham  or  rather  he has not wickham   s countenance  for his 
      features are perfectly good  but how came you to tell me that he 
      was so disagreeable     
 
      elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had 
      liked him better when they had met in kent than before  and that 
      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning  
 
         but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities     
      replied her uncle     your great men often are  and therefore i 
      shall not take him at his word  as he might change his mind 
      another day  and warn me off his grounds     
 
      elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his 
      character  but said nothing  
 
         from what we have seen of him     continued mrs  gardiner     i 
      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so 
      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham  he has not 
      an ill-natured look  on the contrary  there is something pleasing 
      about his mouth when he speaks  and there is something of dignity 
      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea 
      of his heart  but  to be sure  the good lady who showed us his 
      house did give him a most flaming character  i could hardly help 
      laughing aloud sometimes  but he is a liberal master  i suppose  
      and  that  in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue     
 
      elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in 
      vindication of his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them 
      to understand  in as guarded a manner as she could  that by what 
      she had heard from his relations in kent  his actions were 
      capable of a very different construction  and that his character 
      was by no means so faulty  nor wickham   s so amiable  as they had 
      been considered in hertfordshire  in confirmation of this  she 
      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in 
      which they had been connected  without actually naming her 
      authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on  
 
      mrs  gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now 
      approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave 
      way to the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in 
      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its 
      environs to think of anything else  fatigued as she had been by 
      the morning   s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off 
      again in quest of her former acquaintance  and the evening was 
      spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many 
      years    discontinuance  
 
      the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave 
      elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends  and she 
      could do nothing but think  and think with wonder  of mr  darcy   s 
      civility  and  above all  of his wishing her to be acquainted 
      with his sister  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 44 
 
      elizabeth had settled it that mr  darcy would bring his sister to 
      visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was 
      consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole 
      of that morning  but her conclusion was false  for on the very 
      morning after their arrival at lambton  these visitors came  they 
      had been walking about the place with some of their new friends  
      and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining 
      with the same family  when the sound of a carriage drew them to a 
      window  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving 
      up the street  elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery  
      guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of her 
      surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour 
      which she expected  her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and 
      the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke  joined to the 
      circumstance itself  and many of the circumstances of the 
      preceding day  opened to them a new idea on the business  nothing 
      had ever suggested it before  but they felt that there was no 
      other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter 
      than by supposing a partiality for their niece  while these 
      newly-born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation 
      of elizabeth   s feelings was at every moment increasing  she was 
      quite amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of 
      disquiet  she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should 
      have said too much in her favour  and  more than commonly anxious 
      to please  she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing 
      would fail her  
 
      she retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she 
      walked up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw 
      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made 
      everything worse  
 
      miss darcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable 
      introduction took place  with astonishment did elizabeth see that 
      her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself  
      since her being at lambton  she had heard that miss darcy was 
      exceedingly proud  but the observation of a very few minutes 
      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy  she found it 
      difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable  
 
      miss darcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and  
      though little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her 
      appearance womanly and graceful  she was less handsome than her 
      brother  but there was sense and good humour in her face  and her 
      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle  elizabeth  who had 
      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as 
      ever mr  darcy had been  was much relieved by discerning such 
      different feelings  
 
      they had not long been together before mr  darcy told her that 
      bingley was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time 
      to express her satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when 
      bingley   s quick step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he 
      entered the room  all elizabeth   s anger against him had been long 
      done away  but had she still felt any  it could hardly have stood 
      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he 
      expressed himself on seeing her again  he enquired in a friendly  
      though general way  after her family  and looked and spoke with 
      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done  
 
      to mr  and mrs  gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting 
      personage than to herself  they had long wished to see him  the 
      whole party before them  indeed  excited a lively attention  the 
      suspicions which had just arisen of mr  darcy and their niece 
      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though 
      guarded enquiry  and they soon drew from those enquiries the full 
      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love  of 
      the lady   s sensations they remained a little in doubt  but that 
      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough  
 
      elizabeth  on her side  had much to do  she wanted to ascertain 
      the feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her 
      own  and to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter 
      object  where she feared most to fail  she was most sure of 
      success  for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were 
      prepossessed in her favour  bingley was ready  georgiana was 
      eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased  
 
      in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  
      and  oh  how ardently did she long to know whether any of his 
      were directed in a like manner  sometimes she could fancy that he 
      talked less than on former occasions  and once or twice pleased 
      herself with the notion that  as he looked at her  he was trying 
      to trace a resemblance  but  though this might be imaginary  she 
      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy  who had 
      been set up as a rival to jane  no look appeared on either side 
      that spoke particular regard  nothing occurred between them that 
      could justify the hopes of his sister  on this point she was soon 
      satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred ere 
      they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a 
      recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of 
      saying more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared  
      he observed to her  at a moment when the others were talking 
      together  and in a tone which had something of real regret  that 
      it    was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing 
      her     and  before she could reply  he added     it is above eight 
      months  we have not met since the 26th of november  when we were 
      all dancing together at netherfield     
 
      elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he 
      afterwards took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of 
      the rest  whether  all  her sisters were at longbourn  there was 
      not much in the question  nor in the preceding remark  but there 
      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning  
 
      it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr  darcy 
      himself  but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an 
      expression of general complaisance  and in all that he said she 
      heard an accent so removed from  hauteur  or disdain of his 
      companions  as convinced her that the improvement of manners 
      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence 
      might prove  had at least outlived one day  when she saw him thus 
      seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people 
      with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a 
      disgrace   when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to 
      the very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected 
      their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage   the difference  the 
      change was so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she 
      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible  never  
      even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield  or his 
      dignified relations at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to 
      please  so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve  as 
      now  when no importance could result from the success of his 
      endeavours  and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his 
      attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and 
      censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings  
 
      their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour  and when they 
      arose to depart  mr  darcy called on his sister to join him in 
      expressing their wish of seeing mr  and mrs  gardiner  and miss 
      bennet  to dinner at pemberley  before they left the country  
      miss darcy  though with a diffidence which marked her little in 
      the habit of giving invitations  readily obeyed  mrs  gardiner 
      looked at her niece  desirous of knowing how  she   whom the 
      invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its acceptance  
      but elizabeth had turned away her head  presuming however  that 
      this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment 
      than any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who 
      was fond of society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she 
      ventured to engage for her attendance  and the day after the next 
      was fixed on  
 
      bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing 
      elizabeth again  having still a great deal to say to her  and 
      many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends  
      elizabeth  construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak 
      of her sister  was pleased  and on this account  as well as some 
      others  found herself  when their visitors left them  capable of 
      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction  though 
      while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been little  eager 
      to be alone  and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and 
      aunt  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their 
      favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress  
 
      but she had no reason to fear mr  and mrs  gardiner   s curiosity  
      it was not their wish to force her communication  it was evident 
      that she was much better acquainted with mr  darcy than they had 
      before any idea of  it was evident that he was very much in love 
      with her  they saw much to interest  but nothing to justify 
      enquiry  
 
      of mr  darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and  
      as far as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find  
      they could not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn 
      his character from their own feelings and his servant   s report  
      without any reference to any other account  the circle in 
      hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it 
      for mr  darcy  there was now an interest  however  in believing 
      the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible that the authority 
      of a servant who had known him since he was four years old  and 
      whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be hastily 
      rejected  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of 
      their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight  
      they had nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably 
      had  and if not  it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants 
      of a small market-town where the family did not visit  it was 
      acknowledged  however  that he was a liberal man  and did much 
      good among the poor  
 
      with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was 
      not held there in much estimation  for though the chief of his 
      concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood  
      it was yet a well-known fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he 
      had left many debts behind him  which mr  darcy afterwards 
      discharged  
 
      as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening 
      more than the last  and the evening  though as it passed it 
      seemed long  was not long enough to determine her feelings 
      towards  one  in that mansion  and she lay awake two whole hours 
      endeavouring to make them out  she certainly did not hate him  
      no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she had almost as long been 
      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him  that could be so 
      called  the respect created by the conviction of his valuable 
      qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some 
      time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling  and it was now 
      heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony 
      so highly in his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in 
      so amiable a light  which yesterday had produced  but above all  
      above respect and esteem  there was a motive within her of 
      goodwill which could not be overlooked  it was gratitude  
      gratitude  not merely for having once loved her  but for loving 
      her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony 
      of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations 
      accompanying her rejection  he who  she had been persuaded  would 
      avoid her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental 
      meeting  most eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any 
      indelicate display of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where 
      their two selves only were concerned  was soliciting the good 
      opinion of her friends  and bent on making her known to his 
      sister  such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only 
      astonishment but gratitude   for to love  ardent love  it must be 
      attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be 
      encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be 
      exactly defined  she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to 
      him  she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted 
      to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself  
      and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should 
      employ the power  which her fancy told her she still possessed  
      of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses  
 
      it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the 
      niece  that such a striking civility as miss darcy   s in coming to 
      see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had 
      reached it only to a late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though 
      it could not be equalled  by some exertion of politeness on their 
      side  and  consequently  that it would be highly expedient to 
      wait on her at pemberley the following morning  they were  
      therefore  to go  elizabeth was pleased  though when she asked 
      herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply  
 
      mr  gardiner left them soon after breakfast  the fishing scheme 
      had been renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made 
      of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 45 
 
      convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley   s dislike of her 
      had originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how 
      unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was 
      curious to know with how much civility on that lady   s side the 
      acquaintance would now be renewed  
 
      on reaching the house  they were shown through the hall into the 
      saloon  whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer  
      its windows opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing 
      view of the high woody hills behind the house  and of the 
      beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over 
      the intermediate lawn  
 
      in this house they were received by miss darcy  who was sitting 
      there with mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and the lady with whom 
      she lived in london  georgiana   s reception of them was very 
      civil  but attended with all the embarrassment which  though 
      proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily 
      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her 
      being proud and reserved  mrs  gardiner and her niece  however  
      did her justice  and pitied her  
 
      by mrs  hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a 
      curtsey  and  on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such 
      pauses must always be  succeeded for a few moments  it was first 
      broken by mrs  annesley  a genteel  agreeable-looking woman  
      whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to 
      be more truly well-bred than either of the others  and between 
      her and mrs  gardiner  with occasional help from elizabeth  the 
      conversation was carried on  miss darcy looked as if she wished 
      for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a 
      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard  
 
      elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss 
      bingley  and that she could not speak a word  especially to miss 
      darcy  without calling her attention  this observation would not 
      have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter  had they 
      not been seated at an inconvenient distance  but she was not 
      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much  her own thoughts 
      were employing her  she expected every moment that some of the 
      gentlemen would enter the room  she wished  she feared that the 
      master of the house might be amongst them  and whether she wished 
      or feared it most  she could scarcely determine  after sitting in 
      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley   s 
      voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry 
      after the health of her family  she answered with equal 
      indifference and brevity  and the other said no more  
 
      the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the 
      entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all 
      the finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till 
      after many a significant look and smile from mrs  annesley to 
      miss darcy had been given  to remind her of her post  there was 
      now employment for the whole party   for though they could not all 
      talk  they could all eat  and the beautiful pyramids of grapes  
      nectarines  and peaches soon collected them round the table  
 
      while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding 
      whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr  
      darcy  by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  
      and then  though but a moment before she had believed her wishes 
      to predominate  she began to regret that he came  
 
      he had been some time with mr  gardiner  who  with two or three 
      other gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had 
      left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended 
      a visit to georgiana that morning  no sooner did he appear than 
      elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed  
      a resolution the more necessary to be made  but perhaps not the 
      more easily kept  because she saw that the suspicions of the 
      whole party were awakened against them  and that there was 
      scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first 
      came into the room  in no countenance was attentive curiosity so 
      strongly marked as in miss bingley   s  in spite of the smiles 
      which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its 
      objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her 
      attentions to mr  darcy were by no means over  miss darcy  on her 
      brother   s entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and 
      elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to 
      get acquainted  and forwarded as much as possible  every attempt 
      at conversation on either side  miss bingley saw all this 
      likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the first 
      opportunity of saying  with sneering civility  
 
         pray  miss eliza  are not the       shire militia removed from 
      meryton  they must be a great loss to  your  family     
 
      in darcy   s presence she dared not mention wickham   s name  but 
      elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her 
      thoughts  and the various recollections connected with him gave 
      her a moment   s distress  but exerting herself vigorously to repel 
      the ill-natured attack  she presently answered the question in a 
      tolerably detached tone  while she spoke  an involuntary glance 
      showed her darcy  with a heightened complexion  earnestly looking 
      at her  and his sister overcome with confusion  and unable to 
      lift up her eyes  had miss bingley known what pain she was then 
      giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would have refrained 
      from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose 
      elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she 
      believed her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which 
      might injure her in darcy   s opinion  and  perhaps  to remind the 
      latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of 
      her family were connected with that corps  not a syllable had 
      ever reached her of miss darcy   s meditated elopement  to no 
      creature had it been revealed  where secrecy was possible  except 
      to elizabeth  and from all bingley   s connections her brother was 
      particularly anxious to conceal it  from the very wish which 
      elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming 
      hereafter her own  he had certainly formed such a plan  and 
      without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate 
      him from miss bennet  it is probable that it might add something 
      to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend  
 
      elizabeth   s collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his 
      emotion  and as miss bingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not 
      approach nearer to wickham  georgiana also recovered in time  
      though not enough to be able to speak any more  her brother  
      whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely recollected her interest 
      in the affair  and the very circumstance which had been designed 
      to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on 
      her more and more cheerfully  
 
      their visit did not continue long after the question and answer 
      above mentioned  and while mr  darcy was attending them to their 
      carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on 
      elizabeth   s person  behaviour  and dress  but georgiana would not 
      join her  her brother   s recommendation was enough to ensure her 
      favour  his judgement could not err  and he had spoken in such 
      terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of 
      finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  when darcy 
      returned to the saloon  miss bingley could not help repeating to 
      him some part of what she had been saying to his sister  
 
         how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning  mr  darcy     
      she cried     i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she 
      is since the winter  she is grown so brown and coarse  louisa and 
      i were agreeing that we should not have known her again     
 
      however little mr  darcy might have liked such an address  he 
      contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other 
      alteration than her being rather tanned  no miraculous 
      consequence of travelling in the summer  
 
         for my own part     she rejoined     i must confess that i never 
      could see any beauty in her  her face is too thin  her complexion 
      has no brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome  her 
      nose wants character   there is nothing marked in its lines  her 
      teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for 
      her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  i could never 
      see anything extraordinary in them  they have a sharp  shrewish 
      look  which i do not like at all  and in her air altogether there 
      is a self-sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable     
 
      persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth  this 
      was not the best method of recommending herself  but angry people 
      are not always wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat 
      nettled  she had all the success she expected  he was resolutely 
      silent  however  and  from a determination of making him speak  
      she continued  
 
         i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed 
      we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i 
      particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been 
      dining at netherfield      she  a beauty    i should as soon call her 
      mother a wit     but afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and i 
      believe you thought her rather pretty at one time     
 
         yes     replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer     but 
       that  was only when i first saw her  for it is many months since 
      i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my 
      acquaintance     
 
      he then went away  and miss bingley was left to all the 
      satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any 
      pain but herself  
 
      mrs  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred 
      during their visit  as they returned  except what had 
      particularly interested them both  the look and behaviour of 
      everybody they had seen were discussed  except of the person who 
      had mostly engaged their attention  they talked of his sister  
      his friends  his house  his fruit   of everything but himself  yet 
      elizabeth was longing to know what mrs  gardiner thought of him  
      and mrs  gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece   s 
      beginning the subject  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 46 
 
      elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a 
      letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton  and this 
      disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had 
      now been spent there  but on the third her repining was over  and 
      her sister justified  by the receipt of two letters from her at 
      once  on one of which was marked that it had been missent 
      elsewhere  elizabeth was not surprised at it  as jane had written 
      the direction remarkably ill  
 
      they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and 
      her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off 
      by themselves  the one missent must first be attended to  it had 
      been written five days ago  the beginning contained an account of 
      all their little parties and engagements  with such news as the 
      country afforded  but the latter half  which was dated a day 
      later  and written in evident agitation  gave more important 
      intelligence  it was to this effect  
 
         since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred 
      of a most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of 
      alarming you   be assured that we are all well  what i have to say 
      relates to poor lydia  an express came at twelve last night  just 
      as we were all gone to bed  from colonel forster  to inform us 
      that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers  to 
      own the truth  with wickham  imagine our surprise  to kitty  
      however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  i am very  very 
      sorry  so imprudent a match on both sides  but i am willing to 
      hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood  
      thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him  but this 
      step  and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  his 
      choice is disinterested at least  for he must know my father can 
      give her nothing  our poor mother is sadly grieved  my father 
      bears it better  how thankful am i that we never let them know 
      what has been said against him  we must forget it ourselves  they 
      were off saturday night about twelve  as is conjectured  but were 
      not missed till yesterday morning at eight  the express was sent 
      off directly  my dear lizzy  they must have passed within ten 
      miles of us  colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here 
      soon  lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of their 
      intention  i must conclude  for i cannot be long from my poor 
      mother  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but i 
      hardly know what i have written     
 
      without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely 
      knowing what she felt  elizabeth on finishing this letter 
      instantly seized the other  and opening it with the utmost 
      impatience  read as follows  it had been written a day later than 
      the conclusion of the first  
 
         by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried 
      letter  i wish this may be more intelligible  but though not 
      confined for time  my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer 
      for being coherent  dearest lizzy  i hardly know what i would 
      write  but i have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed  
      imprudent as the marriage between mr  wickham and our poor lydia 
      would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place  
      for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to 
      scotland  colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton 
      the day before  not many hours after the express  though lydia   s 
      short letter to mrs  f  gave them to understand that they were 
      going to gretna green  something was dropped by denny expressing 
      his belief that w  never intended to go there  or to marry lydia 
      at all  which was repeated to colonel f   who  instantly taking 
      the alarm  set off from b  intending to trace their route  he did 
      trace them easily to clapham  but no further  for on entering 
      that place  they removed into a hackney coach  and dismissed the 
      chaise that brought them from epsom  all that is known after this 
      is  that they were seen to continue the london road  i know not 
      what to think  after making every possible enquiry on that side 
      london  colonel f  came on into hertfordshire  anxiously renewing 
      them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in barnet and 
      hatfield  but without any success   no such people had been seen to 
      pass through  with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn  
      and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to 
      his heart  i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs  f   but no one 
      can throw any blame on them  our distress  my dear lizzy  is very 
      great  my father and mother believe the worst  but i cannot think 
      so ill of him  many circumstances might make it more eligible for 
      them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first 
      plan  and even if  he  could form such a design against a young 
      woman of lydia   s connections  which is not likely  can i suppose 
      her so lost to everything  impossible  i grieve to find  however  
      that colonel f  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  he 
      shook his head when i expressed my hopes  and said he feared w  
      was not a man to be trusted  my poor mother is really ill  and 
      keeps her room  could she exert herself  it would be better  but 
      this is not to be expected  and as to my father  i never in my 
      life saw him so affected  poor kitty has anger for having 
      concealed their attachment  but as it was a matter of confidence  
      one cannot wonder  i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you have 
      been spared something of these distressing scenes  but now  as 
      the first shock is over  shall i own that i long for your return  
      i am not so selfish  however  as to press for it  if 
      inconvenient  adieu  i take up my pen again to do what i have 
      just told you i would not  but circumstances are such that i 
      cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as 
      possible  i know my dear uncle and aunt so well  that i am not 
      afraid of requesting it  though i have still something more to 
      ask of the former  my father is going to london with colonel 
      forster instantly  to try to discover her  what he means to do i 
      am sure i know not  but his excessive distress will not allow him 
      to pursue any measure in the best and safest way  and colonel 
      forster is obliged to be at brighton again to-morrow evening  in 
      such an exigence  my uncle   s advice and assistance would be 
      everything in the world  he will immediately comprehend what i 
      must feel  and i rely upon his goodness     
 
         oh  where  where is my uncle     cried elizabeth  darting from her 
      seat as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him  
      without losing a moment of the time so precious  but as she 
      reached the door it was opened by a servant  and mr  darcy 
      appeared  her pale face and impetuous manner made him start  and 
      before he could recover himself to speak  she  in whose mind 
      every idea was superseded by lydia   s situation  hastily 
      exclaimed     i beg your pardon  but i must leave you  i must find 
      mr  gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i 
      have not an instant to lose     
 
         good god  what is the matter     cried he  with more feeling than 
      politeness  then recollecting himself     i will not detain you a 
      minute  but let me  or let the servant go after mr  and mrs  
      gardiner  you are not well enough  you cannot go yourself     
 
      elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her and she 
      felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them  
      calling back the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though 
      in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to 
      fetch his master and mistress home instantly  
 
      on his quitting the room she sat down  unable to support herself  
      and looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for darcy to 
      leave her  or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and 
      commiseration     let me call your maid  is there nothing you could 
      take to give you present relief  a glass of wine  shall i get you 
      one  you are very ill     
 
         no  i thank you     she replied  endeavouring to recover herself  
         there is nothing the matter with me  i am quite well  i am only 
      distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from 
      longbourn     
 
      she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes 
      could not speak another word  darcy  in wretched suspense  could 
      only say something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her 
      in compassionate silence  at length she spoke again     i have just 
      had a letter from jane  with such dreadful news  it cannot be 
      concealed from anyone  my younger sister has left all her 
      friends   has eloped  has thrown herself into the power of   of mr  
      wickham  they are gone off together from brighton   you  know him 
      too well to doubt the rest  she has no money  no connections  
      nothing that can tempt him to   she is lost for ever     
 
      darcy was fixed in astonishment     when i consider     she added in 
      a yet more agitated voice     that  i  might have prevented it   i  
      who knew what he was  had i but explained some part of it 
      only   some part of what i learnt  to my own family  had his 
      character been known  this could not have happened  but it is 
      all   all too late now     
 
         i am grieved indeed     cried darcy     grieved   shocked  but is it 
      certain   absolutely certain     
 
         oh  yes  they left brighton together on sunday night  and were 
      traced almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not 
      gone to scotland     
 
         and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover 
      her     
 
         my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my 
      uncle   s immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in 
      half-an-hour  but nothing can be done   i know very well that 
      nothing can be done  how is such a man to be worked on  how are 
      they even to be discovered  i have not the smallest hope  it is 
      every way horrible     
 
      darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence  
 
         when  my  eyes were opened to his real character   oh  had i known 
      what i ought  what i dared to do  but i knew not   i was afraid of 
      doing too much  wretched  wretched mistake     
 
      darcy made no answer  he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was 
      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow 
      contracted  his air gloomy  elizabeth soon observed  and 
      instantly understood it  her power was sinking  everything  must  
      sink under such a proof of family weakness  such an assurance of 
      the deepest disgrace  she could neither wonder nor condemn  but 
      the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to 
      her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress  it was  on the 
      contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own 
      wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have 
      loved him  as now  when all love must be vain  
 
      but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her  
      lydia   the humiliation  the misery she was bringing on them all  
      soon swallowed up every private care  and covering her face with 
      her handkerchief  elizabeth was soon lost to everything else  
      and  after a pause of several minutes  was only recalled to a 
      sense of her situation by the voice of her companion  who  in a 
      manner which  though it spoke compassion  spoke likewise 
      restraint  said     i am afraid you have been long desiring my 
      absence  nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay  but 
      real  though unavailing concern  would to heaven that anything 
      could be either said or done on my part that might offer 
      consolation to such distress  but i will not torment you with 
      vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks  
      this unfortunate affair will  i fear  prevent my sister   s having 
      the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day     
 
         oh  yes  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy  say 
      that urgent business calls us home immediately  conceal the 
      unhappy truth as long as it is possible  i know it cannot be 
      long     
 
      he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow 
      for her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was 
      at present reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her 
      relations  with only one serious  parting look  went away  
 
      as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that 
      they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality 
      as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she 
      threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their 
      acquaintance  so full of contradictions and varieties  sighed at 
      the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted 
      its continuance  and would formerly have rejoiced in its 
      termination  
 
      if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection  
      elizabeth   s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor 
      faulty  but if otherwise   if regard springing from such sources is 
      unreasonable or unnatural  in comparison of what is so often 
      described as arising on a first interview with its object  and 
      even before two words have been exchanged  nothing can be said in 
      her defence  except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the 
      latter method in her partiality for wickham  and that its ill 
      success might  perhaps  authorise her to seek the other less 
      interesting mode of attachment  be that as it may  she saw him go 
      with regret  and in this early example of what lydia   s infamy 
      must produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that 
      wretched business  never  since reading jane   s second letter  had 
      she entertained a hope of wickham   s meaning to marry her  no one 
      but jane  she thought  could flatter herself with such an 
      expectation  surprise was the least of her feelings on this 
      development  while the contents of the first letter remained in 
      her mind  she was all surprise   all astonishment that wickham 
      should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for 
      money  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared 
      incomprehensible  but now it was all too natural  for such an 
      attachment as this she might have sufficient charms  and though 
      she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an 
      elopement without the intention of marriage  she had no 
      difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her 
      understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey  
 
      she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire  
      that lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that 
      lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody  
      sometimes one officer  sometimes another  had been her favourite  
      as their attentions raised them in her opinion  her affections 
      had continually been fluctuating but never without an object  the 
      mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a 
      girl   oh  how acutely did she now feel it  
 
      she was wild to be at home   to hear  to see  to be upon the spot 
      to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon 
      her  in a family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable 
      of exertion  and requiring constant attendance  and though almost 
      persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia  her uncle   s 
      interference seemed of the utmost importance  and till he entered 
      the room her impatience was severe  mr  and mrs  gardiner had 
      hurried back in alarm  supposing by the servant   s account that 
      their niece was taken suddenly ill  but satisfying them instantly 
      on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their 
      summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the 
      postscript of the last with trembling energy     though lydia had 
      never been a favourite with them  mr  and mrs  gardiner could not 
      but be deeply afflicted  not lydia only  but all were concerned 
      in it  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror  
      mr  gardiner promised every assistance in his power  elizabeth  
      though expecting no less  thanked him with tears of gratitude  
      and all three being actuated by one spirit  everything relating 
      to their journey was speedily settled  they were to be off as 
      soon as possible     but what is to be done about pemberley     cried 
      mrs  gardiner     john told us mr  darcy was here when you sent for 
      us  was it so     
 
         yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our 
      engagement   that  is all settled     
 
         that is all settled     repeated the other  as she ran into her 
      room to prepare     and are they upon such terms as for her to 
      disclose the real truth  oh  that i knew how it was     
 
      but wishes were vain  or at least could only serve to amuse her 
      in the hurry and confusion of the following hour  had elizabeth 
      been at leisure to be idle  she would have remained certain that 
      all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself  but 
      she had her share of business as well as her aunt  and amongst 
      the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at 
      lambton  with false excuses for their sudden departure  an hour  
      however  saw the whole completed  and mr  gardiner meanwhile 
      having settled his account at the inn  nothing remained to be 
      done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of the 
      morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could 
      have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to 
      longbourn  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 47 
 
         i have been thinking it over again  elizabeth     said her uncle  
      as they drove from the town     and really  upon serious 
      consideration  i am much more inclined than i was to judge as 
      your eldest sister does on the matter  it appears to me so very 
      unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a 
      girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was 
      actually staying in his colonel   s family  that i am strongly 
      inclined to hope the best  could he expect that her friends would 
      not step forward  could he expect to be noticed again by the 
      regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster  his 
      temptation is not adequate to the risk     
 
         do you really think so     cried elizabeth  brightening up for a 
      moment  
 
         upon my word     said mrs  gardiner     i begin to be of your 
      uncle   s opinion  it is really too great a violation of decency  
      honour  and interest  for him to be guilty of  i cannot think so 
      very ill of wickham  can you yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him 
      up  as to believe him capable of it     
 
         not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest  but of every other 
      neglect i can believe him capable  if  indeed  it should be so  
      but i dare not hope it  why should they not go on to scotland if 
      that had been the case     
 
         in the first place     replied mr  gardiner     there is no absolute 
      proof that they are not gone to scotland     
 
         oh  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is 
      such a presumption  and  besides  no traces of them were to be 
      found on the barnet road     
 
         well  then   supposing them to be in london  they may be there  
      though for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional 
      purpose  it is not likely that money should be very abundant on 
      either side  and it might strike them that they could be more 
      economically  though less expeditiously  married in london than 
      in scotland     
 
         but why all this secrecy  why any fear of detection  why must 
      their marriage be private  oh  no  no   this is not likely  his 
      most particular friend  you see by jane   s account  was persuaded 
      of his never intending to marry her  wickham will never marry a 
      woman without some money  he cannot afford it  and what claims 
      has lydia   what attraction has she beyond youth  health  and good 
      humour that could make him  for her sake  forego every chance of 
      benefiting himself by marrying well  as to what restraint the 
      apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a 
      dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i 
      know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  but 
      as to your other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good  
      lydia has no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from 
      my father   s behaviour  from his indolence and the little 
      attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in 
      his family  that  he  would do as little  and think as little 
      about it  as any father could do  in such a matter     
 
         but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love 
      of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than 
      marriage     
 
         it does seem  and it is most shocking indeed     replied 
      elizabeth  with tears in her eyes     that a sister   s sense of 
      decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt  but  
      really  i know not what to say  perhaps i am not doing her 
      justice  but she is very young  she has never been taught to 
      think on serious subjects  and for the last half-year  nay  for a 
      twelvemonth   she has been given up to nothing but amusement and 
      vanity  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most 
      idle and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in 
      her way  since the       shire were first quartered in meryton  
      nothing but love  flirtation  and officers have been in her head  
      she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and 
      talking on the subject  to give greater   what shall i call it  
      susceptibility to her feelings  which are naturally lively 
      enough  and we all know that wickham has every charm of person 
      and address that can captivate a woman     
 
         but you see that jane     said her aunt     does not think so very 
      ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt     
 
         of whom does jane ever think ill  and who is there  whatever 
      might be their former conduct  that she would think capable of 
      such an attempt  till it were proved against them  but jane 
      knows  as well as i do  what wickham really is  we both know that 
      he has been profligate in every sense of the word  that he has 
      neither integrity nor honour  that he is as false and deceitful 
      as he is insinuating     
 
         and do you really know all this     cried mrs  gardiner  whose 
      curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive  
 
         i do indeed     replied elizabeth  colouring     i told you  the 
      other day  of his infamous behaviour to mr  darcy  and you 
      yourself  when last at longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke 
      of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality 
      towards him  and there are other circumstances which i am not at 
      liberty   which it is not worth while to relate  but his lies about 
      the whole pemberley family are endless  from what he said of miss 
      darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved  
      disagreeable girl  yet he knew to the contrary himself  he must 
      know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found 
      her     
 
         but does lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what 
      you and jane seem so well to understand     
 
         oh  yes    that  that is the worst of all  till i was in kent  and 
      saw so much both of mr  darcy and his relation colonel 
      fitzwilliam  i was ignorant of the truth myself  and when i 
      returned home  the       shire was to leave meryton in a week or 
      fortnight   s time  as that was the case  neither jane  to whom i 
      related the whole  nor i  thought it necessary to make our 
      knowledge public  for of what use could it apparently be to any 
      one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him 
      should then be overthrown  and even when it was settled that 
      lydia should go with mrs  forster  the necessity of opening her 
      eyes to his character never occurred to me  that  she  could be 
      in any danger from the deception never entered my head  that such 
      a consequence as  this  could ensue  you may easily believe  was 
      far enough from my thoughts     
 
         when they all removed to brighton  therefore  you had no reason  
      i suppose  to believe them fond of each other     
 
         not the slightest  i can remember no symptom of affection on 
      either side  and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you 
      must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be 
      thrown away  when first he entered the corps  she was ready 
      enough to admire him  but so we all were  every girl in or near 
      meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months  
      but he never distinguished  her  by any particular attention  
      and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and 
      wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the 
      regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her 
      favourites     
 
      it may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could 
      be added to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this 
      interesting subject  by its repeated discussion  no other could 
      detain them from it long  during the whole of the journey  from 
      elizabeth   s thoughts it was never absent  fixed there by the 
      keenest of all anguish  self-reproach  she could find no interval 
      of ease or forgetfulness  
 
      they travelled as expeditiously as possible  and  sleeping one 
      night on the road  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day  
      it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not 
      have been wearied by long expectations  
 
      the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were 
      standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock  
      and  when the carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise 
      that lighted up their faces  and displayed itself over their 
      whole bodies  in a variety of capers and frisks  was the first 
      pleasing earnest of their welcome  
 
      elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them a hasty 
      kiss  hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running 
      down from her mother   s apartment  immediately met her  
 
      elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears 
      filled the eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether 
      anything had been heard of the fugitives  
 
         not yet     replied jane     but now that my dear uncle is come  i 
      hope everything will be well     
 
         is my father in town     
 
         yes  he went on tuesday  as i wrote you word     
 
         and have you heard from him often     
 
         we have heard only twice  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday 
      to say that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his 
      directions  which i particularly begged him to do  he merely 
      added that he should not write again till he had something of 
      importance to mention     
 
         and my mother   how is she  how are you all     
 
         my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are 
      greatly shaken  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction 
      in seeing you all  she does not yet leave her dressing-room  mary 
      and kitty  thank heaven  are quite well     
 
         but you   how are you     cried elizabeth     you look pale  how much 
      you must have gone through     
 
      her sister  however  assured her of her being perfectly well  and 
      their conversation  which had been passing while mr  and mrs  
      gardiner were engaged with their children  was now put an end to 
      by the approach of the whole party  jane ran to her uncle and 
      aunt  and welcomed and thanked them both  with alternate smiles 
      and tears  
 
      when they were all in the drawing-room  the questions which 
      elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the 
      others  and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to 
      give  the sanguine hope of good  however  which the benevolence 
      of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her  she still 
      expected that it would all end well  and that every morning would 
      bring some letter  either from lydia or her father  to explain 
      their proceedings  and  perhaps  announce their marriage  
 
      mrs  bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few 
      minutes    conversation together  received them exactly as might be 
      expected  with tears and lamentations of regret  invectives 
      against the villainous conduct of wickham  and complaints of her 
      own sufferings and ill-usage  blaming everybody but the person to 
      whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must 
      principally be owing  
 
         if i had been able     said she     to carry my point in going to 
      brighton  with all my family   this  would not have happened  but 
      poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her  why did the 
      forsters ever let her go out of their sight  i am sure there was 
      some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the 
      kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked 
      after  i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge 
      of her  but i was overruled  as i always am  poor dear child  and 
      now here   s mr  bennet gone away  and i know he will fight 
      wickham  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and 
      what is to become of us all  the collinses will turn us out 
      before he is cold in his grave  and if you are not kind to us  
      brother  i do not know what we shall do     
 
      they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr  gardiner  
      after general assurances of his affection for her and all her 
      family  told her that he meant to be in london the very next day  
      and would assist mr  bennet in every endeavour for recovering 
      lydia  
 
         do not give way to useless alarm     added he     though it is right 
      to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it 
      as certain  it is not quite a week since they left brighton  in a 
      few days more we may gain some news of them  and till we know 
      that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not 
      let us give the matter over as lost  as soon as i get to town i 
      shall go to my brother  and make him come home with me to 
      gracechurch street  and then we may consult together as to what 
      is to be done     
 
         oh  my dear brother     replied mrs  bennet     that is exactly what 
      i could most wish for  and now do  when you get to town  find 
      them out  wherever they may be  and if they are not married 
      already   make  them marry  and as for wedding clothes  do not 
      let them wait for that  but tell lydia she shall have as much 
      money as she chooses to buy them  after they are married  and  
      above all  keep mr  bennet from fighting  tell him what a 
      dreadful state i am in  that i am frighted out of my wits   and 
      have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me   such spasms 
      in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that 
      i can get no rest by night nor by day  and tell my dear lydia not 
      to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me  
      for she does not know which are the best warehouses  oh  brother  
      how kind you are  i know you will contrive it all     
 
      but mr  gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest 
      endeavours in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation 
      to her  as well in her hopes as her fear  and after talking with 
      her in this manner till dinner was on the table  they all left 
      her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper  who attended in 
      the absence of her daughters  
 
      though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no 
      real occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not 
      attempt to oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence 
      enough to hold her tongue before the servants  while they waited 
      at table  and judged it better that  one  only of the household  
      and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her 
      fears and solicitude on the subject  
 
      in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who 
      had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make 
      their appearance before  one came from her books  and the other 
      from her toilette  the faces of both  however  were tolerably 
      calm  and no change was visible in either  except that the loss 
      of her favourite sister  or the anger which she had herself 
      incurred in this business  had given more of fretfulness than 
      usual to the accents of kitty  as for mary  she was mistress 
      enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth  with a countenance of 
      grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table  
 
         this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much 
      talked of  but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the 
      wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation     
 
      then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she 
      added     unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from 
      it this useful lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is 
      irretrievable  that one false step involves her in endless ruin  
      that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful  and 
      that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the 
      undeserving of the other sex     
 
      elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much 
      oppressed to make any reply  mary  however  continued to console 
      herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before 
      them  
 
      in the afternoon  the two elder miss bennets were able to be for 
      half-an-hour by themselves  and elizabeth instantly availed 
      herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries  which jane 
      was equally eager to satisfy  after joining in general 
      lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event  which 
      elizabeth considered as all but certain  and miss bennet could 
      not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued the 
      subject  by saying     but tell me all and everything about it 
      which i have not already heard  give me further particulars  what 
      did colonel forster say  had they no apprehension of anything 
      before the elopement took place  they must have seen them 
      together for ever     
 
         colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some 
      partiality  especially on lydia   s side  but nothing to give him 
      any alarm  i am so grieved for him  his behaviour was attentive 
      and kind to the utmost  he  was  coming to us  in order to assure 
      us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone 
      to scotland  when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened 
      his journey     
 
         and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry  did he 
      know of their intending to go off  had colonel forster seen denny 
      himself     
 
         yes  but  when questioned by  him   denny denied knowing 
      anything of their plans  and would not give his real opinion 
      about it  he did not repeat his persuasion of their not 
      marrying   and from  that   i am inclined to hope  he might have 
      been misunderstood before     
 
         and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you 
      entertained a doubt  i suppose  of their being really married     
 
         how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  i 
      felt a little uneasy   a little fearful of my sister   s happiness 
      with him in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not 
      been always quite right  my father and mother knew nothing of 
      that  they only felt how imprudent a match it must be  kitty then 
      owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest 
      of us  that in lydia   s last letter she had prepared her for such 
      a step  she had known  it seems  of their being in love with each 
      other  many weeks     
 
         but not before they went to brighton     
 
         no  i believe not     
 
         and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself  
      does he know his real character     
 
         i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he 
      formerly did  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant  
      and since this sad affair has taken place  it is said that he 
      left meryton greatly in debt  but i hope this may be false     
 
         oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of 
      him  this could not have happened     
 
         perhaps it would have been better     replied her sister     but to 
      expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their 
      present feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  we acted with the 
      best intentions     
 
         could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia   s note to 
      his wife     
 
         he brought it with him for us to see     
 
      jane then took it from her pocket-book  and gave it to elizabeth  
      these were the contents  
 
         my dear harriet  
         you will laugh when you know where i am gone  and i cannot help 
      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning  as soon as i 
      am missed  i am going to gretna green  and if you cannot guess 
      with who  i shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man 
      in the world i love  and he is an angel  i should never be happy 
      without him  so think it no harm to be off  you need not send 
      them word at longbourn of my going  if you do not like it  for it 
      will make the surprise the greater  when i write to them and sign 
      my name    lydia wickham     what a good joke it will be  i can 
      hardly write for laughing  pray make my excuses to pratt for not 
      keeping my engagement  and dancing with him to-night  tell him i 
      hope he will excuse me when he knows all  and tell him i will 
      dance with him at the next ball we meet  with great pleasure  i 
      shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn  but i wish you 
      would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown 
      before they are packed up  good-bye  give my love to colonel 
      forster  i hope you will drink to our good journey  
 
         your affectionate friend  
         lydia bennet     
 
         oh  thoughtless  thoughtless lydia     cried elizabeth when she 
      had finished it     what a letter is this  to be written at such a 
      moment  but at least it shows that  she  was serious on the 
      subject of their journey  whatever he might afterwards persuade 
      her to  it was not on her side a  scheme  of infamy  my poor 
      father  how he must have felt it     
 
         i never saw anyone so shocked  he could not speak a word for 
      full ten minutes  my mother was taken ill immediately  and the 
      whole house in such confusion     
 
         oh  jane     cried elizabeth     was there a servant belonging to it 
      who did not know the whole story before the end of the day     
 
         i do not know  i hope there was  but to be guarded at such a 
      time is very difficult  my mother was in hysterics  and though i 
      endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power  i am afraid 
      i did not do so much as i might have done  but the horror of what 
      might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties     
 
         your attendance upon her has been too much for you  you do not 
      look well  oh that i had been with you  you have had every care 
      and anxiety upon yourself alone     
 
         mary and kitty have been very kind  and would have shared in 
      every fatigue  i am sure  but i did not think it right for either 
      of them  kitty is slight and delicate  and mary studies so much  
      that her hours of repose should not be broken in on  my aunt 
      phillips came to longbourn on tuesday  after my father went away  
      and was so good as to stay till thursday with me  she was of 
      great use and comfort to us all  and lady lucas has been very 
      kind  she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us  
      and offered her services  or any of her daughters     if they 
      should be of use to us     
 
         she had better have stayed at home     cried elizabeth     perhaps 
      she  meant  well  but  under such a misfortune as this  one 
      cannot see too little of one   s neighbours  assistance is 
      impossible  condolence insufferable  let them triumph over us at 
      a distance  and be satisfied     
 
      she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father 
      had intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his 
      daughter  
 
         he meant i believe     replied jane     to go to epsom  the place 
      where they last changed horses  see the postilions and try if 
      anything could be made out from them  his principal object must 
      be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them 
      from clapham  it had come with a fare from london  and as he 
      thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady   s removing 
      from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make 
      enquiries at clapham  if he could anyhow discover at what house 
      the coachman had before set down his fare  he determined to make 
      enquiries there  and hoped it might not be impossible to find out 
      the stand and number of the coach  i do not know of any other 
      designs that he had formed  but he was in such a hurry to be 
      gone  and his spirits so greatly discomposed  that i had 
      difficulty in finding out even so much as this     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 48 
 
      the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr  bennet the 
      next morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line 
      from him  his family knew him to be  on all common occasions  a 
      most negligent and dilatory correspondent  but at such a time 
      they had hoped for exertion  they were forced to conclude that he 
      had no pleasing intelligence to send  but even of  that  they 
      would have been glad to be certain  mr  gardiner had waited only 
      for the letters before he set off  
 
      when he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving 
      constant information of what was going on  and their uncle 
      promised  at parting  to prevail on mr  bennet to return to 
      longbourn  as soon as he could  to the great consolation of his 
      sister  who considered it as the only security for her husband   s 
      not being killed in a duel  
 
      mrs  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a 
      few days longer  as the former thought her presence might be 
      serviceable to her nieces  she shared in their attendance on mrs  
      bennet  and was a great comfort to them in their hours of 
      freedom  their other aunt also visited them frequently  and 
      always  as she said  with the design of cheering and heartening 
      them up   though  as she never came without reporting some fresh 
      instance of wickham   s extravagance or irregularity  she seldom 
      went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found 
      them  
 
      all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who  but three 
      months before  had been almost an angel of light  he was declared 
      to be in debt to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues  
      all honoured with the title of seduction  had been extended into 
      every tradesman   s family  everybody declared that he was the 
      wickedest young man in the world  and everybody began to find out 
      that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness  
      elizabeth  though she did not credit above half of what was said  
      believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister   s ruin 
      more certain  and even jane  who believed still less of it  
      became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come 
      when  if they had gone to scotland  which she had never before 
      entirely despaired of  they must in all probability have gained 
      some news of them  
 
      mr  gardiner left longbourn on sunday  on tuesday his wife 
      received a letter from him  it told them that  on his arrival  he 
      had immediately found out his brother  and persuaded him to come 
      to gracechurch street  that mr  bennet had been to epsom and 
      clapham  before his arrival  but without gaining any satisfactory 
      information  and that he was now determined to enquire at all the 
      principal hotels in town  as mr  bennet thought it possible they 
      might have gone to one of them  on their first coming to london  
      before they procured lodgings  mr  gardiner himself did not 
      expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was 
      eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it  he added that 
      mr  bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london 
      and promised to write again very soon  there was also a 
      postscript to this effect  
 
         i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out  if 
      possible  from some of the young man   s intimates in the regiment  
      whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be 
      likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself  
      if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability 
      of gaining such a clue as that  it might be of essential 
      consequence  at present we have nothing to guide us  colonel 
      forster will  i dare say  do everything in his power to satisfy 
      us on this head  but  on second thoughts  perhaps  lizzy could 
      tell us what relations he has now living  better than any other 
      person     
 
      elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference 
      to her authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give 
      any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment 
      deserved  she had never heard of his having had any relations  
      except a father and mother  both of whom had been dead many 
      years  it was possible  however  that some of his companions in 
      the       shire might be able to give more information  and though 
      she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application was a 
      something to look forward to  
 
      every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most 
      anxious part of each was when the post was expected  the arrival 
      of letters was the grand object of every morning   s impatience  
      through letters  whatever of good or bad was to be told would be 
      communicated  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some 
      news of importance  
 
      but before they heard again from mr  gardiner  a letter arrived 
      for their father  from a different quarter  from mr  collins  
      which  as jane had received directions to open all that came for 
      him in his absence  she accordingly read  and elizabeth  who knew 
      what curiosities his letters always were  looked over her  and 
      read it likewise  it was as follows  
 
         my dear sir  
         i feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation 
      in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are 
      now suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a 
      letter from hertfordshire  be assured  my dear sir  that mrs  
      collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your 
      respectable family  in your present distress  which must be of 
      the bitterest kind  because proceeding from a cause which no time 
      can remove  no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can 
      alleviate so severe a misfortune   or that may comfort you  under a 
      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a 
      parent   s mind  the death of your daughter would have been a 
      blessing in comparison of this  and it is the more to be 
      lamented  because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte 
      informs me  that this licentiousness of behaviour in your 
      daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence  
      though  at the same time  for the consolation of yourself and 
      mrs  bennet  i am inclined to think that her own disposition must 
      be naturally bad  or she could not be guilty of such an enormity  
      at so early an age  howsoever that may be  you are grievously to 
      be pitied  in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs  collins  
      but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter  to whom i have 
      related the affair  they agree with me in apprehending that this 
      false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of 
      all the others  for who  as lady catherine herself 
      condescendingly says  will connect themselves with such a family  
      and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect  with 
      augmented satisfaction  on a certain event of last november  for 
      had it been otherwise  i must have been involved in all your 
      sorrow and disgrace  let me then advise you  dear sir  to console 
      yourself as much as possible  to throw off your unworthy child 
      from your affection for ever  and leave her to reap the fruits of 
      her own heinous offense  
 
         i am  dear sir  etc   etc     
 
      mr  gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer 
      from colonel forster  and then he had nothing of a pleasant 
      nature to send  it was not known that wickham had a single 
      relationship with whom he kept up any connection  and it was 
      certain that he had no near one living  his former acquaintances 
      had been numerous  but since he had been in the militia  it did 
      not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any 
      of them  there was no one  therefore  who could be pointed out as 
      likely to give any news of him  and in the wretched state of his 
      own finances  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy  in 
      addition to his fear of discovery by lydia   s relations  for it 
      had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a 
      very considerable amount  colonel forster believed that more than 
      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at 
      brighton  he owed a good deal in town  but his debts of honour 
      were still more formidable  mr  gardiner did not attempt to 
      conceal these particulars from the longbourn family  jane heard 
      them with horror     a gamester     she cried     this is wholly 
      unexpected  i had not an idea of it     
 
      mr  gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see 
      their father at home on the following day  which was saturday  
      rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours  
      he had yielded to his brother-in-law   s entreaty that he would 
      return to his family  and leave it to him to do whatever occasion 
      might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit  when 
      mrs  bennet was told of this  she did not express so much 
      satisfaction as her children expected  considering what her 
      anxiety for his life had been before  
 
         what  is he coming home  and without poor lydia     she cried  
         sure he will not leave london before he has found them  who is 
      to fight wickham  and make him marry her  if he comes away     
 
      as mrs  gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that 
      she and the children should go to london  at the same time that 
      mr  bennet came from it  the coach  therefore  took them the 
      first stage of their journey  and brought its master back to 
      longbourn  
 
      mrs  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and 
      her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the 
      world  his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them 
      by her niece  and the kind of half-expectation which mrs  
      gardiner had formed  of their being followed by a letter from 
      him  had ended in nothing  elizabeth had received none since her 
      return that could come from pemberley  
 
      the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse 
      for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  nothing  therefore  
      could be fairly conjectured from  that   though elizabeth  who 
      was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings  
      was perfectly aware that  had she known nothing of darcy  she 
      could have borne the dread of lydia   s infamy somewhat better  it 
      would have spared her  she thought  one sleepless night out of 
      two  
 
      when mr  bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual 
      philosophic composure  he said as little as he had ever been in 
      the habit of saying  made no mention of the business that had 
      taken him away  and it was some time before his daughters had 
      courage to speak of it  
 
      it was not till the afternoon  when he had joined them at tea  
      that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  and then  on 
      her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured  
      he replied     say nothing of that  who should suffer but myself  
      it has been my own doing  and i ought to feel it     
 
         you must not be too severe upon yourself     replied elizabeth  
 
         you may well warn me against such an evil  human nature is so 
      prone to fall into it  no  lizzy  let me once in my life feel how 
      much i have been to blame  i am not afraid of being overpowered 
      by the impression  it will pass away soon enough     
 
         do you suppose them to be in london     
 
         yes  where else can they be so well concealed     
 
         and lydia used to want to go to london     added kitty  
 
         she is happy then     said her father drily     and her residence 
      there will probably be of some duration     
 
      then after a short silence he continued  
 
         lizzy  i bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice 
      to me last may  which  considering the event  shows some 
      greatness of mind     
 
      they were interrupted by miss bennet  who came to fetch her 
      mother   s tea  
 
         this is a parade     he cried     which does one good  it gives such 
      an elegance to misfortune  another day i will do the same  i will 
      sit in my library  in my nightcap and powdering gown  and give as 
      much trouble as i can  or  perhaps  i may defer it till kitty 
      runs away     
 
         i am not going to run away  papa     said kitty fretfully     if  i  
      should ever go to brighton  i would behave better than lydia     
 
          you  go to brighton  i would not trust you so near it as 
      eastbourne for fifty pounds  no  kitty  i have at last learnt to 
      be cautious  and you will feel the effects of it  no officer is 
      ever to enter into my house again  nor even to pass through the 
      village  balls will be absolutely prohibited  unless you stand up 
      with one of your sisters  and you are never to stir out of doors 
      till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day 
      in a rational manner     
 
      kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to 
      cry  
 
         well  well     said he     do not make yourself unhappy  if you are 
      a good girl for the next ten years  i will take you to a review 
      at the end of them     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 49 
 
      two days after mr  bennet   s return  as jane and elizabeth were 
      walking together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the 
      housekeeper coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to 
      call them to their mother  went forward to meet her  but  instead 
      of the expected summons  when they approached her  she said to 
      miss bennet     i beg your pardon  madam  for interrupting you  but 
      i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town  so i 
      took the liberty of coming to ask     
 
         what do you mean  hill  we have heard nothing from town     
 
         dear madam     cried mrs  hill  in great astonishment     don   t you 
      know there is an express come for master from mr  gardiner  he 
      has been here this half-hour  and master has had a letter     
 
      away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech  
      they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room  from 
      thence to the library  their father was in neither  and they were 
      on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother  when 
      they were met by the butler  who said  
 
         if you are looking for my master  ma   am  he is walking towards 
      the little copse     
 
      upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall 
      once more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was 
      deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of 
      the paddock  
 
      jane  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as 
      elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for 
      breath  came up with him  and eagerly cried out  
 
         oh  papa  what news   what news  have you heard from my uncle     
 
         yes i have had a letter from him by express     
 
         well  and what news does it bring   good or bad     
 
         what is there of good to be expected     said he  taking the 
      letter from his pocket     but perhaps you would like to read it     
 
      elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand  jane now came up  
 
         read it aloud     said their father     for i hardly know myself 
      what it is about     
 
         gracechurch street   monday  august  2  
 
         my dear brother  
         at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece  and such 
      as  upon the whole  i hope it will give you satisfaction  soon 
      after you left me on saturday  i was fortunate enough to find out 
      in what part of london they were  the particulars i reserve till 
      we meet  it is enough to know they are discovered  i have seen 
      them both       
             then it is as i always hoped     cried jane     they are 
          married     
 
      elizabeth read on  
 
         i have seen them both  they are not married  nor can i find 
      there was any intention of being so  but if you are willing to 
      perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your 
      side  i hope it will not be long before they are  all that is 
      required of you is  to assure to your daughter  by settlement  
      her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your 
      children after the decease of yourself and my sister  and  
      moreover  to enter into an engagement of allowing her  during 
      your life  one hundred pounds per annum  these are conditions 
      which  considering everything  i had no hesitation in complying 
      with  as far as i thought myself privileged  for you  i shall 
      send this by express  that no time may be lost in bringing me 
      your answer  you will easily comprehend  from these particulars  
      that mr  wickham   s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are 
      generally believed to be  the world has been deceived in that 
      respect  and i am happy to say there will be some little money  
      even when all his debts are discharged  to settle on my niece  in 
      addition to her own fortune  if  as i conclude will be the case  
      you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole 
      of this business  i will immediately give directions to 
      haggerston for preparing a proper settlement  there will not be 
      the smallest occasion for your coming to town again  therefore 
      stay quiet at longbourn  and depend on my diligence and care  
      send back your answer as fast as you can  and be careful to write 
      explicitly  we have judged it best that my niece should be 
      married from this house  of which i hope you will approve  she 
      comes to us to-day  i shall write again as soon as anything more 
      is determined on  yours  etc   
 
         edw  gardiner     
 
         is it possible     cried elizabeth  when she had finished     can it 
      be possible that he will marry her     
 
         wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we thought him     said 
      her sister     my dear father  i congratulate you     
 
         and have you answered the letter     cried elizabeth  
 
         no  but it must be done soon     
 
      most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time 
      before he wrote  
 
         oh  my dear father     she cried     come back and write 
      immediately  consider how important every moment is in such a 
      case     
 
         let me write for you     said jane     if you dislike the trouble 
      yourself     
 
         i dislike it very much     he replied     but it must be done     
 
      and so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the 
      house  
 
         and may i ask       said elizabeth     but the terms  i suppose  must 
      be complied with     
 
         complied with  i am only ashamed of his asking so little     
 
         and they  must  marry  yet he is  such  a man     
 
         yes  yes  they must marry  there is nothing else to be done  but 
      there are two things that i want very much to know  one is  how 
      much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about  and the 
      other  how am i ever to pay him     
 
         money  my uncle     cried jane     what do you mean  sir     
 
         i mean  that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight 
      a temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty 
      after i am gone     
 
         that is very true     said elizabeth     though it had not occurred 
      to me before  his debts to be discharged  and something still to 
      remain  oh  it must be my uncle   s doings  generous  good man  i 
      am afraid he has distressed himself  a small sum could not do all 
      this     
 
         no     said her father     wickham   s a fool if he takes her with a 
      farthing less than ten thousand pounds  i should be sorry to 
      think so ill of him  in the very beginning of our relationship     
 
         ten thousand pounds  heaven forbid  how is half such a sum to be 
      repaid     
 
      mr  bennet made no answer  and each of them  deep in thought  
      continued silent till they reached the house  their father then 
      went on to the library to write  and the girls walked into the 
      breakfast-room  
 
         and they are really to be married     cried elizabeth  as soon as 
      they were by themselves     how strange this is  and for  this  we 
      are to be thankful  that they should marry  small as is their 
      chance of happiness  and wretched as is his character  we are 
      forced to rejoice  oh  lydia     
 
         i comfort myself with thinking     replied jane     that he 
      certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for 
      her  though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing 
      him  i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds  or anything like 
      it  has been advanced  he has children of his own  and may have 
      more  how could he spare half ten thousand pounds     
 
         if he were ever able to learn what wickham   s debts have been     
      said elizabeth     and how much is settled on his side on our 
      sister  we shall exactly know what mr  gardiner has done for 
      them  because wickham has not sixpence of his own  the kindness 
      of my uncle and aunt can never be requited  their taking her 
      home  and affording her their personal protection and 
      countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of 
      gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  by this time she is actually 
      with them  if such goodness does not make her miserable now  she 
      will never deserve to be happy  what a meeting for her  when she 
      first sees my aunt     
 
         we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side     
      said jane     i hope and trust they will yet be happy  his 
      consenting to marry her is a proof  i will believe  that he is 
      come to a right way of thinking  their mutual affection will 
      steady them  and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly  
      and live in so rational a manner  as may in time make their past 
      imprudence forgotten     
 
         their conduct has been such     replied elizabeth     as neither 
      you  nor i  nor anybody can ever forget  it is useless to talk of 
      it     
 
      it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all 
      likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened  they went to 
      the library  therefore  and asked their father whether he would 
      not wish them to make it known to her  he was writing and  
      without raising his head  coolly replied  
 
         just as you please     
 
         may we take my uncle   s letter to read to her     
 
         take whatever you like  and get away     
 
      elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table  and they went 
      up stairs together  mary and kitty were both with mrs  bennet  
      one communication would  therefore  do for all  after a slight 
      preparation for good news  the letter was read aloud  mrs  bennet 
      could hardly contain herself  as soon as jane had read mr  
      gardiner   s hope of lydia   s being soon married  her joy burst 
      forth  and every following sentence added to its exuberance  she 
      was now in an irritation as violent from delight  as she had ever 
      been fidgety from alarm and vexation  to know that her daughter 
      would be married was enough  she was disturbed by no fear for her 
      felicity  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct  
 
         my dear  dear lydia     she cried     this is delightful indeed  she 
      will be married  i shall see her again  she will be married at 
      sixteen  my good  kind brother  i knew how it would be  i knew he 
      would manage everything  how i long to see her  and to see dear 
      wickham too  but the clothes  the wedding clothes  i will write 
      to my sister gardiner about them directly  lizzy  my dear  run 
      down to your father  and ask him how much he will give her  stay  
      stay  i will go myself  ring the bell  kitty  for hill  i will 
      put on my things in a moment  my dear  dear lydia  how merry we 
      shall be together when we meet     
 
      her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the 
      violence of these transports  by leading her thoughts to the 
      obligations which mr  gardiner   s behaviour laid them all under  
 
         for we must attribute this happy conclusion     she added     in a 
      great measure to his kindness  we are persuaded that he has 
      pledged himself to assist mr  wickham with money     
 
         well     cried her mother     it is all very right  who should do it 
      but her own uncle  if he had not had a family of his own  i and 
      my children must have had all his money  you know  and it is the 
      first time we have ever had anything from him  except a few 
      presents  well  i am so happy  in a short time i shall have a 
      daughter married  mrs  wickham  how well it sounds  and she was 
      only sixteen last june  my dear jane  i am in such a flutter  
      that i am sure i can   t write  so i will dictate  and you write 
      for me  we will settle with your father about the money 
      afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately     
 
      she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico  muslin  
      and cambric  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful 
      orders  had not jane  though with some difficulty  persuaded her 
      to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted  one day   s 
      delay  she observed  would be of small importance  and her mother 
      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual  other schemes  
      too  came into her head  
 
         i will go to meryton     said she     as soon as i am dressed  and 
      tell the good  good news to my sister philips  and as i come 
      back  i can call on lady lucas and mrs  long  kitty  run down and 
      order the carriage  an airing would do me a great deal of good  i 
      am sure  girls  can i do anything for you in meryton  oh  here 
      comes hill  my dear hill  have you heard the good news  miss 
      lydia is going to be married  and you shall all have a bowl of 
      punch to make merry at her wedding     
 
      mrs  hill began instantly to express her joy  elizabeth received 
      her congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this 
      folly  took refuge in her own room  that she might think with 
      freedom  
 
      poor lydia   s situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it 
      was no worse  she had need to be thankful  she felt it so  and 
      though  in looking forward  neither rational happiness nor 
      worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister  in 
      looking back to what they had feared  only two hours ago  she 
      felt all the advantages of what they had gained  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 50 
 
      mr  bennet had very often wished before this period of his life 
      that  instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an 
      annual sum for the better provision of his children  and of his 
      wife  if she survived him  he now wished it more than ever  had 
      he done his duty in that respect  lydia need not have been 
      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now 
      be purchased for her  the satisfaction of prevailing on one of 
      the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband 
      might then have rested in its proper place  
 
      he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to 
      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his 
      brother-in-law  and he was determined  if possible  to find out 
      the extent of his assistance  and to discharge the obligation as 
      soon as he could  
 
      when first mr  bennet had married  economy was held to be 
      perfectly useless  for  of course  they were to have a son  the 
      son was to join in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should 
      be of age  and the widow and younger children would by that means 
      be provided for  five daughters successively entered the world  
      but yet the son was to come  and mrs  bennet  for many years 
      after lydia   s birth  had been certain that he would  this event 
      had at last been despaired of  but it was then too late to be 
      saving  mrs  bennet had no turn for economy  and her husband   s 
      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their 
      income  
 
      five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs  
      bennet and the children  but in what proportions it should be 
      divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents  
      this was one point  with regard to lydia  at least  which was now 
      to be settled  and mr  bennet could have no hesitation in 
      acceding to the proposal before him  in terms of grateful 
      acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother  though expressed 
      most concisely  he then delivered on paper his perfect 
      approbation of all that was done  and his willingness to fulfil 
      the engagements that had been made for him  he had never before 
      supposed that  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his 
      daughter  it would be done with so little inconvenience to 
      himself as by the present arrangement  he would scarcely be ten 
      pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them  
      for  what with her board and pocket allowance  and the continual 
      presents in money which passed to her through her mother   s hands  
      lydia   s expenses had been very little within that sum  
 
      that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side  
      too  was another very welcome surprise  for his wish at present 
      was to have as little trouble in the business as possible  when 
      the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in 
      seeking her were over  he naturally returned to all his former 
      indolence  his letter was soon dispatched  for  though dilatory 
      in undertaking business  he was quick in its execution  he begged 
      to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his 
      brother  but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her  
 
      the good news spread quickly through the house  and with 
      proportionate speed through the neighbourhood  it was borne in 
      the latter with decent philosophy  to be sure  it would have been 
      more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come 
      upon the town  or  as the happiest alternative  been secluded 
      from the world  in some distant farmhouse  but there was much to 
      be talked of in marrying her  and the good-natured wishes for her 
      well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old 
      ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this 
      change of circumstances  because with such an husband her misery 
      was considered certain  
 
      it was a fortnight since mrs  bennet had been downstairs  but on 
      this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table  
      and in spirits oppressively high  no sentiment of shame gave a 
      damp to her triumph  the marriage of a daughter  which had been 
      the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen  was now on 
      the point of accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran 
      wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new 
      carriages  and servants  she was busily searching through the 
      neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter  and  
      without knowing or considering what their income might be  
      rejected many as deficient in size and importance  
 
         haye park might do     said she     if the gouldings could quit 
      it   or the great house at stoke  if the drawing-room were larger  
      but ashworth is too far off  i could not bear to have her ten 
      miles from me  and as for pulvis lodge  the attics are dreadful     
 
      her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the 
      servants remained  but when they had withdrawn  he said to her  
         mrs  bennet  before you take any or all of these houses for your 
      son and daughter  let us come to a right understanding  into 
       one  house in this neighbourhood they shall never have 
      admittance  i will not encourage the impudence of either  by 
      receiving them at longbourn     
 
      a long dispute followed this declaration  but mr  bennet was 
      firm  it soon led to another  and mrs  bennet found  with 
      amazement and horror  that her husband would not advance a guinea 
      to buy clothes for his daughter  he protested that she should 
      receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion  
      mrs  bennet could hardly comprehend it  that his anger could be 
      carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse 
      his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would 
      scarcely seem valid  exceeded all she could believe possible  she 
      was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must 
      reflect on her daughter   s nuptials  than to any sense of shame at 
      her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took 
      place  
 
      elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the 
      distress of the moment  been led to make mr  darcy acquainted 
      with their fears for her sister  for since her marriage would so 
      shortly give the proper termination to the elopement  they might 
      hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who 
      were not immediately on the spot  
 
      she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means  there 
      were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently 
      depended  but  at the same time  there was no one whose knowledge 
      of a sister   s frailty would have mortified her so much   not  
      however  from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to 
      herself  for  at any rate  there seemed a gulf impassable between 
      them  had lydia   s marriage been concluded on the most honourable 
      terms  it was not to be supposed that mr  darcy would connect 
      himself with a family where  to every other objection  would now 
      be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a 
      man whom he so justly scorned  
 
      from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink  
      the wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself 
      of his feeling in derbyshire  could not in rational expectation 
      survive such a blow as this  she was humbled  she was grieved  
      she repented  though she hardly knew of what  she became jealous 
      of his esteem  when she could no longer hope to be benefited by 
      it  she wanted to hear of him  when there seemed the least chance 
      of gaining intelligence  she was convinced that she could have 
      been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they should 
      meet  
 
      what a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that 
      the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago  
      would now have been most gladly and gratefully received  he was 
      as generous  she doubted not  as the most generous of his sex  
      but while he was mortal  there must be a triumph  
 
      she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who  in 
      disposition and talents  would most suit her  his understanding 
      and temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her 
      wishes  it was an union that must have been to the advantage of 
      both  by her ease and liveliness  his mind might have been 
      softened  his manners improved  and from his judgement  
      information  and knowledge of the world  she must have received 
      benefit of greater importance  
 
      but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude 
      what connubial felicity really was  an union of a different 
      tendency  and precluding the possibility of the other  was soon 
      to be formed in their family  
 
      how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable 
      independence  she could not imagine  but how little of permanent 
      happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together 
      because their passions were stronger than their virtue  she could 
      easily conjecture  
 
      mr  gardiner soon wrote again to his brother  to mr  bennet   s 
      acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurance of his 
      eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family  and 
      concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be 
      mentioned to him again  the principal purport of his letter was 
      to inform them that mr  wickham had resolved on quitting the 
      militia  
 
         it was greatly my wish that he should do so     he added     as soon 
      as his marriage was fixed on  and i think you will agree with me  
      in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable  
      both on his account and my niece   s  it is mr  wickham   s intention 
      to go into the regulars  and among his former friends  there are 
      still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army  he 
      has the promise of an ensigncy in general          s regiment  now 
      quartered in the north  it is an advantage to have it so far from 
      this part of the kingdom  he promises fairly  and i hope among 
      different people  where they may each have a character to 
      preserve  they will both be more prudent  i have written to 
      colonel forster  to inform him of our present arrangements  and 
      to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr  
      wickham in and near brighton  with assurances of speedy payment  
      for which i have pledged myself  and will you give yourself the 
      trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in 
      meryton  of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his 
      information  he has given in all his debts  i hope at least he 
      has not deceived us  haggerston has our directions  and all will 
      be completed in a week  they will then join his regiment  unless 
      they are first invited to longbourn  and i understand from mrs  
      gardiner  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before 
      she leaves the south  she is well  and begs to be dutifully 
      remembered to you and her mother    yours  etc   
 
         e  gardiner     
 
      mr  bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham   s 
      removal from the       shire as clearly as mr  gardiner could do  but 
      mrs  bennet was not so well pleased with it  lydia   s being 
      settled in the north  just when she had expected most pleasure 
      and pride in her company  for she had by no means given up her 
      plan of their residing in hertfordshire  was a severe 
      disappointment  and  besides  it was such a pity that lydia 
      should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with 
      everybody  and had so many favourites  
 
         she is so fond of mrs  forster     said she     it will be quite 
      shocking to send her away  and there are several of the young 
      men  too  that she likes very much  the officers may not be so 
      pleasant in general          s regiment     
 
      his daughter   s request  for such it might be considered  of being 
      admitted into her family again before she set off for the north  
      received at first an absolute negative  but jane and elizabeth  
      who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister   s feelings 
      and consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by 
      her parents  urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so 
      mildly  to receive her and her husband at longbourn  as soon as 
      they were married  that he was prevailed on to think as they 
      thought  and act as they wished  and their mother had the 
      satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her 
      married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to 
      the north  when mr  bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore  
      he sent his permission for them to come  and it was settled  that 
      as soon as the ceremony was over  they should proceed to 
      longbourn  elizabeth was surprised  however  that wickham should 
      consent to such a scheme  and had she consulted only her own 
      inclination  any meeting with him would have been the last object 
      of her wishes  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 51 
 
      their sister   s wedding day arrived  and jane and elizabeth felt 
      for her probably more than she felt for herself  the carriage was 
      sent to meet them at         and they were to return in it by 
      dinner-time  their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets  
      and jane more especially  who gave lydia the feelings which would 
      have attended herself  had  she  been the culprit  and was 
      wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure  
 
      they came  the family were assembled in the breakfast room to 
      receive them  smiles decked the face of mrs  bennet as the 
      carriage drove up to the door  her husband looked impenetrably 
      grave  her daughters  alarmed  anxious  uneasy  
 
      lydia   s voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown 
      open  and she ran into the room  her mother stepped forwards  
      embraced her  and welcomed her with rapture  gave her hand  with 
      an affectionate smile  to wickham  who followed his lady  and 
      wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of 
      their happiness  
 
      their reception from mr  bennet  to whom they then turned  was 
      not quite so cordial  his countenance rather gained in austerity  
      and he scarcely opened his lips  the easy assurance of the young 
      couple  indeed  was enough to provoke him  elizabeth was 
      disgusted  and even miss bennet was shocked  lydia was lydia 
      still  untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy  and fearless  she turned 
      from sister to sister  demanding their congratulations  and when 
      at length they all sat down  looked eagerly round the room  took 
      notice of some little alteration in it  and observed  with a 
      laugh  that it was a great while since she had been there  
 
      wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his 
      manners were always so pleasing  that had his character and his 
      marriage been exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy 
      address  while he claimed their relationship  would have 
      delighted them all  elizabeth had not before believed him quite 
      equal to such assurance  but she sat down  resolving within 
      herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an 
      impudent man   she  blushed  and jane blushed  but the cheeks of 
      the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of 
      colour  
 
      there was no want of discourse  the bride and her mother could 
      neither of them talk fast enough  and wickham  who happened to 
      sit near elizabeth  began enquiring after his acquaintance in 
      that neighbourhood  with a good humoured ease which she felt very 
      unable to equal in her replies  they seemed each of them to have 
      the happiest memories in the world  nothing of the past was 
      recollected with pain  and lydia led voluntarily to subjects 
      which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world  
 
         only think of its being three months     she cried     since i went 
      away  it seems but a fortnight i declare  and yet there have been 
      things enough happened in the time  good gracious  when i went 
      away  i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came 
      back again  though i thought it would be very good fun if i was     
 
      her father lifted up his eyes  jane was distressed  elizabeth 
      looked expressively at lydia  but she  who never heard nor saw 
      anything of which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued  
         oh  mamma  do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day  i 
      was afraid they might not  and we overtook william goulding in 
      his curricle  so i was determined he should know it  and so i let 
      down the side-glass next to him  and took off my glove  and let 
      my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that he might see the 
      ring  and then i bowed and smiled like anything     
 
      elizabeth could bear it no longer  she got up  and ran out of the 
      room  and returned no more  till she heard them passing through 
      the hall to the dining parlour  she then joined them soon enough 
      to see lydia  with anxious parade  walk up to her mother   s right 
      hand  and hear her say to her eldest sister     ah  jane  i take 
      your place now  and you must go lower  because i am a married 
      woman     
 
      it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that 
      embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first  
      her ease and good spirits increased  she longed to see mrs  
      phillips  the lucases  and all their other neighbours  and to 
      hear herself called    mrs  wickham    by each of them  and in the 
      mean time  she went after dinner to show her ring  and boast of 
      being married  to mrs  hill and the two housemaids  
 
         well  mamma     said she  when they were all returned to the 
      breakfast room     and what do you think of my husband  is not he a 
      charming man  i am sure my sisters must all envy me  i only hope 
      they may have half my good luck  they must all go to brighton  
      that is the place to get husbands  what a pity it is  mamma  we 
      did not all go     
 
         very true  and if i had my will  we should  but my dear lydia  i 
      don   t at all like your going such a way off  must it be so     
 
         oh  lord  yes    there is nothing in that  i shall like it of all 
      things  you and papa  and my sisters  must come down and see us  
      we shall be at newcastle all the winter  and i dare say there 
      will be some balls  and i will take care to get good partners for 
      them all     
 
         i should like it beyond anything     said her mother  
 
         and then when you go away  you may leave one or two of my 
      sisters behind you  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them 
      before the winter is over     
 
         i thank you for my share of the favour     said elizabeth     but i 
      do not particularly like your way of getting husbands     
 
      their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  mr  
      wickham had received his commission before he left london  and he 
      was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight  
 
      no one but mrs  bennet regretted that their stay would be so 
      short  and she made the most of the time by visiting about with 
      her daughter  and having very frequent parties at home  these 
      parties were acceptable to all  to avoid a family circle was even 
      more desirable to such as did think  than such as did not  
 
      wickham   s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had 
      expected to find it  not equal to lydia   s for him  she had 
      scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied  from the 
      reason of things  that their elopement had been brought on by the 
      strength of her love  rather than by his  and she would have 
      wondered why  without violently caring for her  he chose to elope 
      with her at all  had she not felt certain that his flight was 
      rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and if that were 
      the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of 
      having a companion  
 
      lydia was exceedingly fond of him  he was her dear wickham on 
      every occasion  no one was to be put in competition with him  he 
      did every thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill 
      more birds on the first of september  than any body else in the 
      country  
 
      one morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with 
      her two elder sisters  she said to elizabeth  
 
         lizzy  i never gave  you  an account of my wedding  i believe  
      you were not by  when i told mamma and the others all about it  
      are not you curious to hear how it was managed     
 
         no really     replied elizabeth     i think there cannot be too 
      little said on the subject     
 
         la  you are so strange  but i must tell you how it went off  we 
      were married  you know  at st  clement   s  because wickham   s 
      lodgings were in that parish  and it was settled that we should 
      all be there by eleven o   clock  my uncle and aunt and i were to 
      go together  and the others were to meet us at the church  well  
      monday morning came  and i was in such a fuss  i was so afraid  
      you know  that something would happen to put it off  and then i 
      should have gone quite distracted  and there was my aunt  all the 
      time i was dressing  preaching and talking away just as if she 
      was reading a sermon  however  i did not hear above one word in 
      ten  for i was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear wickham  i 
      longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat     
 
         well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  i thought it would 
      never be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my 
      uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with 
      them  if you   ll believe me  i did not once put my foot out of 
      doors  though i was there a fortnight  not one party  or scheme  
      or anything  to be sure london was rather thin  but  however  the 
      little theatre was open  well  and so just as the carriage came 
      to the door  my uncle was called away upon business to that 
      horrid man mr  stone  and then  you know  when once they get 
      together  there is no end of it  well  i was so frightened i did 
      not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we 
      were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day  but  
      luckily  he came back again in ten minutes    time  and then we all 
      set out  however  i recollected afterwards that if he  had  been 
      prevented going  the wedding need not be put off  for mr  darcy 
      might have done as well     
 
         mr  darcy     repeated elizabeth  in utter amazement  
 
         oh  yes    he was to come there with wickham  you know  but 
      gracious me  i quite forgot  i ought not to have said a word 
      about it  i promised them so faithfully  what will wickham say  
      it was to be such a secret     
 
         if it was to be secret     said jane     say not another word on the 
      subject  you may depend upon my seeking no further     
 
         oh  certainly     said elizabeth  though burning with curiosity  
         we will ask you no questions     
 
         thank you     said lydia     for if you did  i should certainly tell 
      you all  and then wickham would be angry     
 
      on such encouragement to ask  elizabeth was forced to put it out 
      of her power  by running away  
 
      but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at 
      least it was impossible not to try for information  mr  darcy had 
      been at her sister   s wedding  it was exactly a scene  and exactly 
      among people  where he had apparently least to do  and least 
      temptation to go  conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and 
      wild  hurried into her brain  but she was satisfied with none  
      those that best pleased her  as placing his conduct in the 
      noblest light  seemed most improbable  she could not bear such 
      suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  wrote a short 
      letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what lydia had 
      dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been 
      intended  
 
         you may readily comprehend     she added     what my curiosity must 
      be to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and 
       comparatively speaking  a stranger to our family  should have 
      been amongst you at such a time  pray write instantly  and let me 
      understand it   unless it is  for very cogent reasons  to remain in 
      the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary  and then i must 
      endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance     
 
         not that i  shall   though     she added to herself  as she 
      finished the letter     and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in 
      an honourable manner  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and 
      stratagems to find it out     
 
      jane   s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to 
      elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  elizabeth was 
      glad of it    till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive 
      any satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 52 
 
      elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her 
      letter as soon as she possibly could  she was no sooner in 
      possession of it than  hurrying into the little copse  where she 
      was least likely to be interrupted  she sat down on one of the 
      benches and prepared to be happy  for the length of the letter 
      convinced her that it did not contain a denial  
 
         gracechurch street   sept   6  
 
         my dear niece  
 
         i have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole 
      morning to answering it  as i foresee that a  little  writing 
      will not comprise what i have to tell you  i must confess myself 
      surprised by your application  i did not expect it from  you   
      don   t think me angry  however  for i only mean to let you know 
      that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on  your  
      side  if you do not choose to understand me  forgive my 
      impertinence  your uncle is as much surprised as i am   and nothing 
      but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed 
      him to act as he has done  but if you are really innocent and 
      ignorant  i must be more explicit  
 
         on the very day of my coming home from longbourn  your uncle had 
      a most unexpected visitor  mr  darcy called  and was shut up with 
      him several hours  it was all over before i arrived  so my 
      curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as  yours  seems to have 
      been  he came to tell mr  gardiner that he had found out where 
      your sister and mr  wickham were  and that he had seen and talked 
      with them both  wickham repeatedly  lydia once  from what i can 
      collect  he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves  and 
      came to town with the resolution of hunting for them  the motive 
      professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that 
      wickham   s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it 
      impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in 
      him  he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride  and 
      confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his 
      private actions open to the world  his character was to speak for 
      itself  he called it  therefore  his duty to step forward  and 
      endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself  
      if he  had another  motive  i am sure it would never disgrace 
      him  he had been some days in town  before he was able to 
      discover them  but he had something to direct his search  which 
      was more than  we  had  and the consciousness of this was another 
      reason for his resolving to follow us  
 
         there is a lady  it seems  a mrs  younge  who was some time ago 
      governess to miss darcy  and was dismissed from her charge on 
      some cause of disapprobation  though he did not say what  she 
      then took a large house in edward-street  and has since 
      maintained herself by letting lodgings  this mrs  younge was  he 
      knew  intimately acquainted with wickham  and he went to her for 
      intelligence of him as soon as he got to town  but it was two or 
      three days before he could get from her what he wanted  she would 
      not betray her trust  i suppose  without bribery and corruption  
      for she really did know where her friend was to be found  wickham 
      indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london  and had 
      she been able to receive them into her house  they would have 
      taken up their abode with her  at length  however  our kind 
      friend procured the wished-for direction  they were in        street  
      he saw wickham  and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia  his 
      first object with her  he acknowledged  had been to persuade her 
      to quit her present disgraceful situation  and return to her 
      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her  
      offering his assistance  as far as it would go  but he found 
      lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was  she cared 
      for none of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not 
      hear of leaving wickham  she was sure they should be married some 
      time or other  and it did not much signify when  since such were 
      her feelings  it only remained  he thought  to secure and 
      expedite a marriage  which  in his very first conversation with 
      wickham  he easily learnt had never been  his  design  he 
      confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment  on account of 
      some debts of honour  which were very pressing  and scrupled not 
      to lay all the ill-consequences of lydia   s flight on her own 
      folly alone  he meant to resign his commission immediately  and 
      as to his future situation  he could conjecture very little about 
      it  he must go somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew 
      he should have nothing to live on  
 
         mr  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once  
      though mr  bennet was not imagined to be very rich  he would have 
      been able to do something for him  and his situation must have 
      been benefited by marriage  but he found  in reply to this 
      question  that wickham still cherished the hope of more 
      effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country  
      under such circumstances  however  he was not likely to be proof 
      against the temptation of immediate relief  
 
         they met several times  for there was much to be discussed  
      wickham of course wanted more than he could get  but at length 
      was reduced to be reasonable  
 
         everything being settled between  them   mr  darcy   s next step 
      was to make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in 
      gracechurch street the evening before i came home  but mr  
      gardiner could not be seen  and mr  darcy found  on further 
      enquiry  that your father was still with him  but would quit town 
      the next morning  he did not judge your father to be a person 
      whom he could so properly consult as your uncle  and therefore 
      readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the 
      former  he did not leave his name  and till the next day it was 
      only known that a gentleman had called on business  
 
         on saturday he came again  your father was gone  your uncle at 
      home  and  as i said before  they had a great deal of talk 
      together  
 
         they met again on sunday  and then  i  saw him too  it was not 
      all settled before monday  as soon as it was  the express was 
      sent off to longbourn  but our visitor was very obstinate  i 
      fancy  lizzy  that obstinacy is the real defect of his character  
      after all  he has been accused of many faults at different times  
      but  this  is the true one  nothing was to be done that he did 
      not do himself  though i am sure  and i do not speak it to be 
      thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your uncle would most 
      readily have settled the whole  
 
         they battled it together for a long time  which was more than 
      either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved  but at 
      last your uncle was forced to yield  and instead of being allowed 
      to be of use to his niece  was forced to put up with only having 
      the probable credit of it  which went sorely against the grain  
      and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great 
      pleasure  because it required an explanation that would rob him 
      of his borrowed feathers  and give the praise where it was due  
      but  lizzy  this must go no farther than yourself  or jane at 
      most  
 
         you know pretty well  i suppose  what has been done for the 
      young people  his debts are to be paid  amounting  i believe  to 
      considerably more than a thousand pounds  another thousand in 
      addition to her own settled upon  her   and his commission 
      purchased  the reason why all this was to be done by him alone  
      was such as i have given above  it was owing to him  to his 
      reserve and want of proper consideration  that wickham   s 
      character had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he had 
      been received and noticed as he was  perhaps there was some truth 
      in  this   though i doubt whether  his  reserve  or  anybody   s  
      reserve  can be answerable for the event  but in spite of all 
      this fine talking  my dear lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured 
      that your uncle would never have yielded  if we had not given him 
      credit for  another interest  in the affair  
 
         when all this was resolved on  he returned again to his friends  
      who were still staying at pemberley  but it was agreed that he 
      should be in london once more when the wedding took place  and 
      all money matters were then to receive the last finish  
 
         i believe i have now told you every thing  it is a relation 
      which you tell me is to give you great surprise  i hope at least 
      it will not afford you any displeasure  lydia came to us  and 
      wickham had constant admission to the house   he  was exactly 
      what he had been  when i knew him in hertfordshire  but i would 
      not tell you how little i was satisfied with  her  behaviour 
      while she staid with us  if i had not perceived  by jane   s letter 
      last wednesday  that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a 
      piece with it  and therefore what i now tell you can give you no 
      fresh pain  i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious 
      manner  representing to her all the wickedness of what she had 
      done  and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family  if 
      she heard me  it was by good luck  for i am sure she did not 
      listen  i was sometimes quite provoked  but then i recollected my 
      dear elizabeth and jane  and for their sakes had patience with 
      her  
 
         mr  darcy was punctual in his return  and as lydia informed you  
      attended the wedding  he dined with us the next day  and was to 
      leave town again on wednesday or thursday  will you be very angry 
      with me  my dear lizzy  if i take this opportunity of saying 
       what i was never bold enough to say before  how much i like him  
      his behaviour to us has  in every respect  been as pleasing as 
      when we were in derbyshire  his understanding and opinions all 
      please me  he wants nothing but a little more liveliness  and 
       that   if he marry  prudently   his wife may teach him  i 
      thought him very sly    he hardly ever mentioned your name  but 
      slyness seems the fashion  
 
         pray forgive me if i have been very presuming  or at least do 
      not punish me so far as to exclude me from p  i shall never be 
      quite happy till i have been all round the park  a low phaeton  
      with a nice little pair of ponies  would be the very thing  
 
         but i must write no more  the children have been wanting me this 
      half hour  
 
         yours  very sincerely  
         m  gardiner     
 
      the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of 
      spirits  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure 
      or pain bore the greatest share  the vague and unsettled 
      suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr  darcy might 
      have been doing to forward her sister   s match  which she had 
      feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be 
      probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the pain 
      of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be 
      true  he had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on 
      himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a 
      research  in which supplication had been necessary to a woman 
      whom he must abominate and despise  and where he was reduced to 
      meet  frequently meet  reason with  persuade  and finally bribe  
      the man whom he always most wished to avoid  and whose very name 
      it was punishment to him to pronounce  he had done all this for a 
      girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem  her heart did 
      whisper that he had done it for her  but it was a hope shortly 
      checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her 
      vanity was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection 
      for her   for a woman who had already refused him   as able to 
      overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against 
      relationship with wickham  brother-in-law of wickham  every kind 
      of pride must revolt from the connection  he had  to be sure  
      done much  she was ashamed to think how much  but he had given a 
      reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary stretch 
      of belief  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been 
      wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it  
      and though she would not place herself as his principal 
      inducement  she could  perhaps  believe that remaining partiality 
      for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of 
      mind must be materially concerned  it was painful  exceedingly 
      painful  to know that they were under obligations to a person who 
      could never receive a return  they owed the restoration of lydia  
      her character  every thing  to him  oh  how heartily did she 
      grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged  
      every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  for herself 
      she was humbled  but she was proud of him  proud that in a cause 
      of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of 
      himself  she read over her aunt   s commendation of him again and 
      again  it was hardly enough  but it pleased her  she was even 
      sensible of some pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding 
      how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that 
      affection and confidence subsisted between mr  darcy and herself  
 
      she was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one   s 
      approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was 
      overtaken by wickham  
 
         i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister     
      said he  as he joined her  
 
         you certainly do     she replied with a smile     but it does not 
      follow that the interruption must be unwelcome     
 
         i should be sorry indeed  if it were   we  were always good 
      friends  and now we are better     
 
         true  are the others coming out     
 
         i do not know  mrs  bennet and lydia are going in the carriage 
      to meryton  and so  my dear sister  i find  from our uncle and 
      aunt  that you have actually seen pemberley     
 
      she replied in the affirmative  
 
         i almost envy you the pleasure  and yet i believe it would be 
      too much for me  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle  
      and you saw the old housekeeper  i suppose  poor reynolds  she 
      was always very fond of me  but of course she did not mention my 
      name to you     
 
         yes  she did     
 
         and what did she say     
 
         that you were gone into the army  and she was afraid had   not 
      turned out well  at such a distance as  that   you know  things 
      are strangely misrepresented     
 
         certainly     he replied  biting his lips  elizabeth hoped she had 
      silenced him  but he soon afterwards said  
 
         i was surprised to see darcy in town last month  we passed each 
      other several times  i wonder what he can be doing there     
 
         perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh     said 
      elizabeth     it must be something particular  to take him there at 
      this time of year     
 
         undoubtedly  did you see him while you were at lambton  i 
      thought i understood from the gardiners that you had     
 
         yes  he introduced us to his sister     
 
         and do you like her     
 
         very much     
 
         i have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within 
      this year or two  when i last saw her  she was not very 
      promising  i am very glad you liked her  i hope she will turn out 
      well     
 
         i dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age     
 
         did you go by the village of kympton     
 
         i do not recollect that we did     
 
         i mention it  because it is the living which i ought to have 
      had  a most delightful place    excellent parsonage house  it would 
      have suited me in every respect     
 
         how should you have liked making sermons     
 
         exceedingly well  i should have considered it as part of my 
      duty  and the exertion would soon have been nothing  one ought 
      not to repine    but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing 
      for me  the quiet  the retirement of such a life would have 
      answered all my ideas of happiness  but it was not to be  did you 
      ever hear darcy mention the circumstance  when you were in kent     
 
         i  have  heard from authority  which i thought  as good   that 
      it was left you conditionally only  and at the will of the 
      present patron     
 
         you have  yes  there was something in  that   i told you so from 
      the first  you may remember     
 
         i  did  hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon-making was 
      not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you 
      actually declared your resolution of never taking orders  and 
      that the business had been compromised accordingly     
 
         you did  and it was not wholly without foundation  you may 
      remember what i told you on that point  when first we talked of 
      it     
 
      they were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked 
      fast to get rid of him  and unwilling  for her sister   s sake  to 
      provoke him  she only said in reply  with a good-humoured smile  
 
         come  mr  wickham  we are brother and sister  you know  do not 
      let us quarrel about the past  in future  i hope we shall be 
      always of one mind     
 
      she held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry  
      though he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 53 
 
      mr  wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation 
      that he never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear 
      sister elizabeth  by introducing the subject of it  and she was 
      pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet  
 
      the day of his and lydia   s departure soon came  and mrs  bennet 
      was forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no 
      means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle  
      was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth  
 
         oh  my dear lydia     she cried     when shall we meet again     
 
         oh  lord  i don   t know  not these two or three years  perhaps     
 
         write to me very often  my dear     
 
         as often as i can  but you know married women have never much 
      time for writing  my sisters may write to  me   they will have 
      nothing else to do     
 
      mr  wickham   s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife   s  
      he smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things  
 
         he is as fine a fellow     said mr  bennet  as soon as they were 
      out of the house     as ever i saw  he simpers  and smirks  and 
      makes love to us all  i am prodigiously proud of him  i defy even 
      sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law     
 
      the loss of her daughter made mrs  bennet very dull for several 
      days  
 
         i often think     said she     that there is nothing so bad as 
      parting with one   s friends  one seems so forlorn without them     
 
         this is the consequence  you see  madam  of marrying a 
      daughter     said elizabeth     it must make you better satisfied 
      that your other four are single     
 
         it is no such thing  lydia does not leave me because she is 
      married  but only because her husband   s regiment happens to be so 
      far off  if that had been nearer  she would not have gone so 
      soon     
 
      but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was 
      shortly relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of 
      hope  by an article of news which then began to be in 
      circulation  the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders 
      to prepare for the arrival of her master  who was coming down in 
      a day or two  to shoot there for several weeks  mrs  bennet was 
      quite in the fidgets  she looked at jane  and smiled and shook 
      her head by turns  
 
         well  well  and so mr  bingley is coming down  sister      for 
      mrs  phillips first brought her the news      well  so much the 
      better  not that i care about it  though  he is nothing to us  
      you know  and i am sure i never want to see him again  but  
      however  he is very welcome to come to netherfield  if he likes 
      it  and who knows what  may  happen  but that is nothing to us  
      you know  sister  we agreed long ago never to mention a word 
      about it  and so  is it quite certain he is coming     
 
         you may depend on it     replied the other     for mrs  nicholls was 
      in meryton last night  i saw her passing by  and went out myself 
      on purpose to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was 
      certain true  he comes down on thursday at the latest  very 
      likely on wednesday  she was going to the butcher   s  she told me  
      on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday  and she has got 
      three couple of ducks just fit to be killed     
 
      miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without 
      changing colour  it was many months since she had mentioned his 
      name to elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together  
      she said  
 
         i saw you look at me to-day  lizzy  when my aunt told us of the 
      present report  and i know i appeared distressed  but don   t 
      imagine it was from any silly cause  i was only confused for the 
      moment  because i felt that i  should  be looked at  i do assure 
      you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or 
      pain  i am glad of one thing  that he comes alone  because we 
      shall see the less of him  not that i am afraid of  myself   but 
      i dread other people   s remarks     
 
      elizabeth did not know what to make of it  had she not seen him 
      in derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming 
      there with no other view than what was acknowledged  but she 
      still thought him partial to jane  and she wavered as to the 
      greater probability of his coming there  with  his friend   s 
      permission  or being bold enough to come without it  
 
         yet it is hard     she sometimes thought     that this poor man 
      cannot come to a house which he has legally hired  without 
      raising all this speculation  i  will  leave him to himself     
 
      in spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be 
      her feelings in the expectation of his arrival  elizabeth could 
      easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it  they were 
      more disturbed  more unequal  than she had often seen them  
 
      the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their 
      parents  about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again  
 
         as soon as ever mr  bingley comes  my dear     said mrs  bennet  
         you will wait on him of course     
 
         no  no  you forced me into visiting him last year  and promised  
      if i went to see him  he should marry one of my daughters  but it 
      ended in nothing  and i will not be sent on a fool   s errand 
      again     
 
      his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an 
      attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his 
      returning to netherfield  
 
            tis an  etiquette  i despise     said he     if he wants our 
      society  let him seek it  he knows where we live  i will not 
      spend  my  hours in running after my neighbours every time they 
      go away and come back again     
 
         well  all i know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do 
      not wait on him  but  however  that shan   t prevent my asking him 
      to dine here  i am determined  we must have mrs  long and the 
      gouldings soon  that will make thirteen with ourselves  so there 
      will be just room at table for him     
 
      consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her 
      husband   s incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that 
      her neighbours might all see mr  bingley  in consequence of it  
      before  they  did  as the day of his arrival drew near     
 
         i begin to be sorry that he comes at all     said jane to her 
      sister     it would be nothing  i could see him with perfect 
      indifference  but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually 
      talked of  my mother means well  but she does not know  no one 
      can know  how much i suffer from what she says  happy shall i be  
      when his stay at netherfield is over     
 
         i wish i could say anything to comfort you     replied elizabeth  
         but it is wholly out of my power  you must feel it  and the 
      usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied 
      me  because you have always so much     
 
      mr  bingley arrived  mrs  bennet  through the assistance of 
      servants  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the 
      period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as 
      it could  she counted the days that must intervene before their 
      invitation could be sent  hopeless of seeing him before  but on 
      the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire  she saw 
      him  from her dressing-room window  enter the paddock and ride 
      towards the house  
 
      her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  jane 
      resolutely kept her place at the table  but elizabeth  to satisfy 
      her mother  went to the window   she looked    she saw mr  darcy with 
      him  and sat down again by her sister  
 
         there is a gentleman with him  mamma     said kitty     who can it 
      be     
 
         some acquaintance or other  my dear  i suppose  i am sure i do 
      not know     
 
         la     replied kitty     it looks just like that man that used to be 
      with him before  mr  what   s-his-name  that tall  proud man     
 
         good gracious  mr  darcy    and so it does  i vow  well  any 
      friend of mr  bingley   s will always be welcome here  to be sure  
      but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him     
 
      jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern  she knew but 
      little of their meeting in derbyshire  and therefore felt for the 
      awkwardness which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost 
      for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter  both 
      sisters were uncomfortable enough  each felt for the other  and 
      of course for themselves  and their mother talked on  of her 
      dislike of mr  darcy  and her resolution to be civil to him only 
      as mr  bingley   s friend  without being heard by either of them  
      but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be 
      suspected by jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew 
      mrs  gardiner   s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment 
      towards him  to jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she 
      had refused  and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own 
      more extensive information  he was the person to whom the whole 
      family were indebted for the first of benefits  and whom she 
      regarded herself with an interest  if not quite so tender  at 
      least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley  her 
      astonishment at his coming   at his coming to netherfield  to 
      longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  was almost equal to 
      what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in 
      derbyshire  
 
      the colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half 
      a minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added 
      lustre to her eyes  as she thought for that space of time that 
      his affection and wishes must still be unshaken  but she would 
      not be secure  
 
         let me first see how he behaves     said she     it will then be 
      early enough for expectation     
 
      she sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without 
      daring to lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them 
      to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the 
      door  jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than 
      elizabeth had expected  on the gentlemen   s appearing  her colour 
      increased  yet she received them with tolerable ease  and with a 
      propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of 
      resentment or any unnecessary complaisance  
 
      elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and 
      sat down again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not 
      often command  she had ventured only one glance at darcy  he 
      looked serious  as usual  and  she thought  more as he had been 
      used to look in hertfordshire  than as she had seen him at 
      pemberley  but  perhaps he could not in her mother   s presence be 
      what he was before her uncle and aunt  it was a painful  but not 
      an improbable  conjecture  
 
      bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short 
      period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  he was 
      received by mrs  bennet with a degree of civility which made her 
      two daughters ashamed  especially when contrasted with the cold 
      and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his 
      friend  
 
      elizabeth  particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the 
      latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from 
      irremediable infamy  was hurt and distressed to a most painful 
      degree by a distinction so ill applied  
 
      darcy  after enquiring of her how mr  and mrs  gardiner did  a 
      question which she could not answer without confusion  said 
      scarcely anything  he was not seated by her  perhaps that was the 
      reason of his silence  but it had not been so in derbyshire  
      there he had talked to her friends  when he could not to herself  
      but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his 
      voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist the impulse of 
      curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often found 
      him looking at jane as at herself  and frequently on no object 
      but the ground  more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please  
      than when they last met  were plainly expressed  she was 
      disappointed  and angry with herself for being so  
 
         could i expect it to be otherwise     said she     yet why did he 
      come     
 
      she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself  
      and to him she had hardly courage to speak  
 
      she enquired after his sister  but could do no more  
 
         it is a long time  mr  bingley  since you went away     said mrs  
      bennet  
 
      he readily agreed to it  
 
         i began to be afraid you would never come back again  people 
       did  say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas  
      but  however  i hope it is not true  a great many changes have 
      happened in the neighbourhood  since you went away  miss lucas is 
      married and settled  and one of my own daughters  i suppose you 
      have heard of it  indeed  you must have seen it in the papers  it 
      was in the times and the courier  i know  though it was not put 
      in as it ought to be  it was only said     lately  george wickham  
      esq  to miss lydia bennet     without there being a syllable said 
      of her father  or the place where she lived  or anything  it was 
      my brother gardiner   s drawing up too  and i wonder how he came to 
      make such an awkward business of it  did you see it     
 
      bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations  
      elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes  how mr  darcy looked  
      therefore  she could not tell  
 
         it is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well 
      married     continued her mother     but at the same time  mr  
      bingley  it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me  
      they are gone down to newcastle  a place quite northward  it 
      seems  and there they are to stay i do not know how long  his 
      regiment is there  for i suppose you have heard of his leaving 
      the       shire  and of his being gone into the regulars  thank 
      heaven  he has  some  friends  though perhaps not so many as he 
      deserves     
 
      elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at mr  darcy  was in such 
      misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat  it drew 
      from her  however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else 
      had so effectually done before  and she asked bingley whether he 
      meant to make any stay in the country at present  a few weeks  he 
      believed  
 
         when you have killed all your own birds  mr  bingley     said her 
      mother     i beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you 
      please on mr  bennet   s manor  i am sure he will be vastly happy 
      to oblige you  and will save all the best of the covies for you     
 
      elizabeth   s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious 
      attention  were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had 
      flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would 
      be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  at that instant  
      she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself 
      amends for moments of such painful confusion  
 
         the first wish of my heart     said she to herself     is never more 
      to be in company with either of them  their society can afford no 
      pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this  let me 
      never see either one or the other again     
 
      yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no 
      compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from 
      observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the 
      admiration of her former lover  when first he came in  he had 
      spoken to her but little  but every five minutes seemed to be 
      giving her more of his attention  he found her as handsome as she 
      had been last year  as good natured  and as unaffected  though 
      not quite so chatty  jane was anxious that no difference should 
      be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded that she 
      talked as much as ever  but her mind was so busily engaged  that 
      she did not always know when she was silent  
 
      when the gentlemen rose to go away  mrs  bennet was mindful of 
      her intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine 
      at longbourn in a few days time  
 
         you are quite a visit in my debt  mr  bingley     she added     for 
      when you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family 
      dinner with us  as soon as you returned  i have not forgot  you 
      see  and i assure you  i was very much disappointed that you did 
      not come back and keep your engagement     
 
      bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said 
      something of his concern at having been prevented by business  
      they then went away  
 
      mrs  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and 
      dine there that day  but  though she always kept a very good 
      table  she did not think anything less than two courses could be 
      good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs  or 
      satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a 
      year  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 54 
 
      as soon as they were gone  elizabeth walked out to recover her 
      spirits  or in other words  to dwell without interruption on 
      those subjects that must deaden them more  mr  darcy   s behaviour 
      astonished and vexed her  
 
         why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent     said 
      she     did he come at all     
 
      she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure  
 
         he could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt  
      when he was in town  and why not to me  if he fears me  why come 
      hither  if he no longer cares for me  why silent  teasing  
      teasing  man  i will think no more about him     
 
      her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the 
      approach of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look  
      which showed her better satisfied with their visitors  than 
      elizabeth  
 
         now     said she     that this first meeting is over  i feel 
      perfectly easy  i know my own strength  and i shall never be 
      embarrassed again by his coming  i am glad he dines here on 
      tuesday  it will then be publicly seen that  on both sides  we 
      meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance     
 
         yes  very indifferent indeed     said elizabeth  laughingly     oh  
      jane  take care     
 
         my dear lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger 
      now     
 
         i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in 
      love with you as ever     
 
      they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  and mrs  
      bennet  in the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy 
      schemes  which the good humour and common politeness of bingley  
      in half an hour   s visit  had revived  
 
      on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  and 
      the two who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their 
      punctuality as sportsmen  were in very good time  when they 
      repaired to the dining-room  elizabeth eagerly watched to see 
      whether bingley would take the place  which  in all their former 
      parties  had belonged to him  by her sister  her prudent mother  
      occupied by the same ideas  forbore to invite him to sit by 
      herself  on entering the room  he seemed to hesitate  but jane 
      happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was decided  he 
      placed himself by her  
 
      elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his 
      friend  he bore it with noble indifference  and she would have 
      imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had 
      she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr  darcy  with an 
      expression of half-laughing alarm  
 
      his behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as 
      showed an admiration of her  which  though more guarded than 
      formerly  persuaded elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself  
      jane   s happiness  and his own  would be speedily secured  though 
      she dared not depend upon the consequence  she yet received 
      pleasure from observing his behaviour  it gave her all the 
      animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in no 
      cheerful humour  mr  darcy was almost as far from her as the 
      table could divide them  he was on one side of her mother  she 
      knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either  
      or make either appear to advantage  she was not near enough to 
      hear any of their discourse  but she could see how seldom they 
      spoke to each other  and how formal and cold was their manner 
      whenever they did  her mother   s ungraciousness  made the sense of 
      what they owed him more painful to elizabeth   s mind  and she 
      would  at times  have given anything to be privileged to tell him 
      that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of 
      the family  
 
      she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity 
      of bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not 
      pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of 
      conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his 
      entrance  anxious and uneasy  the period which passed in the 
      drawing-room  before the gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull 
      to a degree that almost made her uncivil  she looked forward to 
      their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure 
      for the evening must depend  
 
         if he does not come to me   then      said she     i shall give him 
      up for ever     
 
      the gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have 
      answered her hopes  but  alas  the ladies had crowded round the 
      table  where miss bennet was making tea  and elizabeth pouring 
      out the coffee  in so close a confederacy that there was not a 
      single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair  and on the 
      gentlemen   s approaching  one of the girls moved closer to her 
      than ever  and said  in a whisper  
 
         the men shan   t come and part us  i am determined  we want none 
      of them  do we     
 
      darcy had walked away to another part of the room  she followed 
      him with her eyes  envied everyone to whom he spoke  had scarcely 
      patience enough to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged 
      against herself for being so silly  
 
         a man who has once been refused  how could i ever be foolish 
      enough to expect a renewal of his love  is there one among the 
      sex  who would not protest against such a weakness as a second 
      proposal to the same woman  there is no indignity so abhorrent to 
      their feelings     
 
      she was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his 
      coffee cup himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying  
 
         is your sister at pemberley still     
 
         yes  she will remain there till christmas     
 
         and quite alone  have all her friends left her     
 
         mrs  annesley is with her  the others have been gone on to 
      scarborough  these three weeks     
 
      she could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to 
      converse with her  he might have better success  he stood by her  
      however  for some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young 
      lady   s whispering to elizabeth again  he walked away  
 
      when the tea-things were removed  and the card-tables placed  the 
      ladies all rose  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined 
      by him  when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a 
      victim to her mother   s rapacity for whist players  and in a few 
      moments after seated with the rest of the party  she now lost 
      every expectation of pleasure  they were confined for the evening 
      at different tables  and she had nothing to hope  but that his 
      eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room  as to 
      make him play as unsuccessfully as herself  
 
      mrs  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to 
      supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of 
      the others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them  
 
         well girls     said she  as soon as they were left to themselves  
         what say you to the day  i think every thing has passed off 
      uncommonly well  i assure you  the dinner was as well dressed as 
      any i ever saw  the venison was roasted to a turn   and everybody 
      said they never saw so fat a haunch  the soup was fifty times 
      better than what we had at the lucases    last week  and even mr  
      darcy acknowledged  that the partridges were remarkably well 
      done  and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least  
      and  my dear jane  i never saw you look in greater beauty  mrs  
      long said so too  for i asked her whether you did not  and what 
      do you think she said besides     ah  mrs  bennet  we shall have 
      her at netherfield at last     she did indeed  i do think mrs  long 
      is as good a creature as ever lived   and her nieces are very 
      pretty behaved girls  and not at all handsome  i like them 
      prodigiously     
 
      mrs  bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen 
      enough of bingley   s behaviour to jane  to be convinced that she 
      would get him at last  and her expectations of advantage to her 
      family  when in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that 
      she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next 
      day  to make his proposals  
 
         it has been a very agreeable day     said miss bennet to 
      elizabeth     the party seemed so well selected  so suitable one 
      with the other  i hope we may often meet again     
 
      elizabeth smiled  
 
         lizzy  you must not do so  you must not suspect me  it mortifies 
      me  i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation 
      as an agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish 
      beyond it  i am perfectly satisfied  from what his manners now 
      are  that he never had any design of engaging my affection  it is 
      only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address  and a 
      stronger desire of generally pleasing  than any other man     
 
         you are very cruel     said her sister     you will not let me 
      smile  and are provoking me to it every moment     
 
         how hard it is in some cases to be believed     
 
         and how impossible in others     
 
         but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i 
      acknowledge     
 
         that is a question which i hardly know how to answer  we all 
      love to instruct  though we can teach only what is not worth 
      knowing  forgive me  and if you persist in indifference  do not 
      make  me  your confidante     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 55 
 
      a few days after this visit  mr  bingley called again  and alone  
      his friend had left him that morning for london  but was to 
      return home in ten days time  he sat with them above an hour  and 
      was in remarkably good spirits  mrs  bennet invited him to dine 
      with them  but  with many expressions of concern  he confessed 
      himself engaged elsewhere  
 
         next time you call     said she     i hope we shall be more lucky     
 
      he should be particularly happy at any time  etc  etc   and if 
      she would give him leave  would take an early opportunity of 
      waiting on them  
 
         can you come to-morrow     
 
      yes  he had no engagement at all for to-morrow  and her 
      invitation was accepted with alacrity  
 
      he came  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of 
      them dressed  in ran mrs  bennet to her daughter   s room  in her 
      dressing gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out  
 
         my dear jane  make haste and hurry down  he is come   mr  bingley 
      is come  he is  indeed  make haste  make haste  here  sarah  come 
      to miss bennet this moment  and help her on with her gown  never 
      mind miss lizzy   s hair     
 
         we will be down as soon as we can     said jane     but i dare say 
      kitty is forwarder than either of us  for she went up stairs half 
      an hour ago     
 
         oh  hang kitty  what has she to do with it  come be quick  be 
      quick  where is your sash  my dear     
 
      but when her mother was gone  jane would not be prevailed on to 
      go down without one of her sisters  
 
      the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in 
      the evening  after tea  mr  bennet retired to the library  as was 
      his custom  and mary went up stairs to her instrument  two 
      obstacles of the five being thus removed  mrs  bennet sat looking 
      and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time  
      without making any impression on them  elizabeth would not 
      observe her  and when at last kitty did  she very innocently 
      said     what is the matter mamma  what do you keep winking at me 
      for  what am i to do     
 
         nothing child  nothing  i did not wink at you     she then sat 
      still five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious 
      occasion  she suddenly got up  and saying to kitty     come here  
      my love  i want to speak to you     took her out of the room  jane 
      instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at 
      such premeditation  and her entreaty that  she  would not give in 
      to it  in a few minutes  mrs  bennet half-opened the door and 
      called out  
 
         lizzy  my dear  i want to speak with you     
 
      elizabeth was forced to go  
 
         we may as well leave them by themselves you know     said her 
      mother  as soon as she was in the hall     kitty and i are going up 
      stairs to sit in my dressing-room     
 
      elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained 
      quietly in the hall  till she and kitty were out of sight  then 
      returned into the drawing-room  
 
      mrs  bennet   s schemes for this day were ineffectual  bingley was 
      every thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her 
      daughter  his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable 
      addition to their evening party  and he bore with the ill-judged 
      officiousness of the mother  and heard all her silly remarks with 
      a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to 
      the daughter  
 
      he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  and before he 
      went away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and 
      mrs  bennet   s means  for his coming next morning to shoot with 
      her husband  
 
      after this day  jane said no more of her indifference  not a word 
      passed between the sisters concerning bingley  but elizabeth went 
      to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded  
      unless mr  darcy returned within the stated time  seriously  
      however  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have 
      taken place with that gentleman   s concurrence  
 
      bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and mr  bennet 
      spent the morning together  as had been agreed on  the latter was 
      much more agreeable than his companion expected  there was 
      nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his 
      ridicule  or disgust him into silence  and he was more 
      communicative  and less eccentric  than the other had ever seen 
      him  bingley of course returned with him to dinner  and in the 
      evening mrs  bennet   s invention was again at work to get every 
      body away from him and her daughter  elizabeth  who had a letter 
      to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon 
      after tea  for as the others were all going to sit down to cards  
      she could not be wanted to counteract her mother   s schemes  
 
      but on returning to the drawing-room  when her letter was 
      finished  she saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to 
      fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her  on opening 
      the door  she perceived her sister and bingley standing together 
      over the hearth  as if engaged in earnest conversation  and had 
      this led to no suspicion  the faces of both  as they hastily 
      turned round and moved away from each other  would have told it 
      all   their  situation was awkward enough  but  hers  she thought 
      was still worse  not a syllable was uttered by either  and 
      elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when bingley  who 
      as well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering 
      a few words to her sister  ran out of the room  
 
      jane could have no reserves from elizabeth  where confidence 
      would give pleasure  and instantly embracing her  acknowledged  
      with the liveliest emotion  that she was the happiest creature in 
      the world  
 
            tis too much     she added     by far too much  i do not deserve 
      it  oh  why is not everybody as happy     
 
      elizabeth   s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a 
      warmth  a delight  which words could but poorly express  every 
      sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane  but 
      she would not allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half 
      that remained to be said for the present  
 
         i must go instantly to my mother     she cried     i would not on 
      any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  or allow her 
      to hear it from anyone but myself  he is gone to my father 
      already  oh  lizzy  to know that what i have to relate will give 
      such pleasure to all my dear family  how shall i bear so much 
      happiness     
 
      she then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up 
      the card party  and was sitting up stairs with kitty  
 
      elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity 
      and ease with which an affair was finally settled  that had given 
      them so many previous months of suspense and vexation  
 
         and this     said she     is the end of all his friend   s anxious 
      circumspection  of all his sister   s falsehood and contrivance  
      the happiest  wisest  most reasonable end     
 
      in a few minutes she was joined by bingley  whose conference with 
      her father had been short and to the purpose  
 
         where is your sister     said he hastily  as he opened the door  
 
         with my mother up stairs  she will be down in a moment  i dare 
      say     
 
      he then shut the door  and  coming up to her  claimed the good 
      wishes and affection of a sister  elizabeth honestly and heartily 
      expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship  they 
      shook hands with great cordiality  and then  till her sister came 
      down  she had to listen to all he had to say of his own 
      happiness  and of jane   s perfections  and in spite of his being a 
      lover  elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity 
      to be rationally founded  because they had for basis the 
      excellent understanding  and super-excellent disposition of jane  
      and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and 
      himself  
 
      it was an evening of no common delight to them all  the 
      satisfaction of miss bennet   s mind gave a glow of such sweet 
      animation to her face  as made her look handsomer than ever  
      kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped her turn was coming soon  
      mrs  bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation 
      in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  though she talked 
      to bingley of nothing else for half an hour  and when mr  bennet 
      joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly showed how 
      really happy he was  
 
      not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till 
      their visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was 
      gone  he turned to his daughter  and said  
 
         jane  i congratulate you  you will be a very happy woman     
 
      jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his 
      goodness  
 
         you are a good girl     he replied     and i have great pleasure in 
      thinking you will be so happily settled  i have not a doubt of 
      your doing very well together  your tempers are by no means 
      unlike  you are each of you so complying  that nothing will ever 
      be resolved on  so easy  that every servant will cheat you  and 
      so generous  that you will always exceed your income     
 
         i hope not so  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters 
      would be unpardonable in  me      
 
         exceed their income  my dear mr  bennet     cried his wife     what 
      are you talking of  why  he has four or five thousand a year  and 
      very likely more     then addressing her daughter     oh  my dear  
      dear jane  i am so happy  i am sure i shan   t get a wink of sleep 
      all night  i knew how it would be  i always said it must be so  
      at last  i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing  i 
      remember  as soon as ever i saw him  when he first came into 
      hertfordshire last year  i thought how likely it was that you 
      should come together  oh  he is the handsomest young man that 
      ever was seen     
 
      wickham  lydia  were all forgotten  jane was beyond competition 
      her favourite child  at that moment  she cared for no other  her 
      younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects 
      of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense  
 
      mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  and 
      kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter  
 
      bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at 
      longbourn  coming frequently before breakfast  and always 
      remaining till after supper  unless when some barbarous 
      neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an 
      invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept  
 
      elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her 
      sister  for while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow 
      on anyone else  but she found herself considerably useful to both 
      of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur  
      in the absence of jane  he always attached himself to elizabeth  
      for the pleasure of talking of her  and when bingley was gone  
      jane constantly sought the same means of relief  
 
         he has made me so happy     said she  one evening     by telling me 
      that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring  i 
      had not believed it possible     
 
         i suspected as much     replied elizabeth     but how did he account 
      for it     
 
         it must have been his sister   s doing  they were certainly no 
      friends to his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at  
      since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many 
      respects  but when they see  as i trust they will  that their 
      brother is happy with me  they will learn to be contented  and we 
      shall be on good terms again  though we can never be what we once 
      were to each other     
 
         that is the most unforgiving speech     said elizabeth     that i 
      ever heard you utter  good girl  it would vex me  indeed  to see 
      you again the dupe of miss bingley   s pretended regard     
 
         would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last 
      november  he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of 
       my  being indifferent would have prevented his coming down 
      again     
 
         he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of 
      his modesty     
 
      this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his 
      diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good 
      qualities  elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed 
      the interference of his friend  for  though jane had the most 
      generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a 
      circumstance which must prejudice her against him  
 
         i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed     
      cried jane     oh  lizzy  why am i thus singled from my family  and 
      blessed above them all  if i could but see you as happy  if there 
      were but such another man for you     
 
         if you were to give me forty such men  i never could be so happy 
      as you  till i have your disposition  your goodness  i never can 
      have your happiness  no  no  let me shift for myself  and  
      perhaps  if i have very good luck  i may meet with another mr  
      collins in time     
 
      the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be 
      long a secret  mrs  bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs  
      phillips  and she ventured  without any permission  to do the 
      same by all her neighbours in meryton  
 
      the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in 
      the world  though only a few weeks before  when lydia had first 
      run away  they had been generally proved to be marked out for 
      misfortune  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 56 
 
      one morning  about a week after bingley   s engagement with jane 
      had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting 
      together in the dining-room  their attention was suddenly drawn 
      to the window  by the sound of a carriage  and they perceived a 
      chaise and four driving up the lawn  it was too early in the 
      morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to 
      that of any of their neighbours  the horses were post  and 
      neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded 
      it  were familiar to them  as it was certain  however  that 
      somebody was coming  bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet 
      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with 
      him into the shrubbery  they both set off  and the conjectures of 
      the remaining three continued  though with little satisfaction  
      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered  it was 
      lady catherine de bourgh  
 
      they were of course all intending to be surprised  but their 
      astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of 
      mrs  bennet and kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them  
      even inferior to what elizabeth felt  
 
      she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious  
      made no other reply to elizabeth   s salutation than a slight 
      inclination of the head  and sat down without saying a word  
      elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship   s 
      entrance  though no request of introduction had been made  
 
      mrs  bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of 
      such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness  
      after sitting for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to 
      elizabeth  
 
         i hope you are well  miss bennet  that lady  i suppose  is your 
      mother     
 
      elizabeth replied very concisely that she was  
 
         and  that  i suppose is one of your sisters     
 
         yes  madam     said mrs  bennet  delighted to speak to lady 
      catherine     she is my youngest girl but one  my youngest of all 
      is lately married  and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds  
      walking with a young man who  i believe  will soon become a part 
      of the family     
 
         you have a very small park here     returned lady catherine after 
      a short silence  
 
         it is nothing in comparison of rosings  my lady  i dare say  but 
      i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas   s     
 
         this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening  
      in summer  the windows are full west     
 
      mrs  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  
      and then added  
 
         may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left 
      mr  and mrs  collins well     
 
         yes  very well  i saw them the night before last     
 
      elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her 
      from charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her 
      calling  but no letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled  
 
      mrs  bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take 
      some refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not 
      very politely  declined eating anything  and then  rising up  
      said to elizabeth  
 
         miss bennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little 
      wilderness on one side of your lawn  i should be glad to take a 
      turn in it  if you will favour me with your company     
 
         go  my dear     cried her mother     and show her ladyship about the 
      different walks  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage     
 
      elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol  
      attended her noble guest downstairs  as they passed through the 
      hall  lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and 
      drawing-room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be 
      decent looking rooms  walked on  
 
      her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeth saw that her 
      waiting-woman was in it  they proceeded in silence along the 
      gravel walk that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to 
      make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more 
      than usually insolent and disagreeable  
 
         how could i ever think her like her nephew     said she  as she 
      looked in her face  
 
      as soon as they entered the copse  lady catherine began in the 
      following manner     
 
         you can be at no loss  miss bennet  to understand the reason of 
      my journey hither  your own heart  your own conscience  must tell 
      you why i come     
 
      elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment  
 
         indeed  you are mistaken  madam  i have not been at all able to 
      account for the honour of seeing you here     
 
         miss bennet     replied her ladyship  in an angry tone     you ought 
      to know  that i am not to be trifled with  but however insincere 
       you  may choose to be  you shall not find  me  so  my character 
      has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in 
      a cause of such moment as this  i shall certainly not depart from 
      it  a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago  i 
      was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most 
      advantageously married  but that you  that miss elizabeth bennet  
      would  in all likelihood  be soon afterwards united to my nephew  
      my own nephew  mr  darcy  though i  know  it must be a scandalous 
      falsehood  though i would not injure him so much as to suppose 
      the truth of it possible  i instantly resolved on setting off for 
      this place  that i might make my sentiments known to you     
 
         if you believed it impossible to be true     said elizabeth  
      colouring with astonishment and disdain     i wonder you took the 
      trouble of coming so far  what could your ladyship propose by 
      it     
 
         at once to insist upon having such a report universally 
      contradicted     
 
         your coming to longbourn  to see me and my family     said 
      elizabeth coolly     will be rather a confirmation of it  if  
      indeed  such a report is in existence     
 
         if  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it  has it not been 
      industriously circulated by yourselves  do you not know that such 
      a report is spread abroad     
 
         i never heard that it was     
 
         and can you likewise declare  that there is no  foundation  for 
      it     
 
         i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship  
       you  may ask questions which  i  shall not choose to answer     
 
         this is not to be borne  miss bennet  i insist on being 
      satisfied  has he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage     
 
         your ladyship has declared it to be impossible     
 
         it ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of 
      his reason  but  your  arts and allurements may  in a moment of 
      infatuation  have made him forget what he owes to himself and to 
      all his family  you may have drawn him in     
 
         if i have  i shall be the last person to confess it     
 
         miss bennet  do you know who i am  i have not been accustomed to 
      such language as this  i am almost the nearest relation he has in 
      the world  and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns     
 
         but you are not entitled to know  mine   nor will such behaviour 
      as this  ever induce me to be explicit     
 
         let me be rightly understood  this match  to which you have the 
      presumption to aspire  can never take place  no  never  mr  darcy 
      is engaged to  my daughter   now what have you to say     
 
         only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose 
      he will make an offer to me     
 
      lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied  
 
         the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  from their 
      infancy  they have been intended for each other  it was the 
      favourite wish of  his  mother  as well as of hers  while in 
      their cradles  we planned the union  and now  at the moment when 
      the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their 
      marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth  of 
      no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to the family  do 
      you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends  to his tacit 
      engagement with miss de bourgh  are you lost to every feeling of 
      propriety and delicacy  have you not heard me say that from his 
      earliest hours he was destined for his cousin     
 
         yes  and i had heard it before  but what is that to me  if there 
      is no other objection to my marrying your nephew  i shall 
      certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt 
      wished him to marry miss de bourgh  you both did as much as you 
      could in planning the marriage  its completion depended on 
      others  if mr  darcy is neither by honour nor inclination 
      confined to his cousin  why is not he to make another choice  and 
      if i am that choice  why may not i accept him     
 
         because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it  
      yes  miss bennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by 
      his family or friends  if you wilfully act against the 
      inclinations of all  you will be censured  slighted  and 
      despised  by everyone connected with him  your alliance will be a 
      disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned by any of us     
 
         these are heavy misfortunes     replied elizabeth     but the wife 
      of mr  darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness 
      necessarily attached to her situation  that she could  upon the 
      whole  have no cause to repine     
 
         obstinate  headstrong girl  i am ashamed of you  is this your 
      gratitude for my attentions to you last spring  is nothing due to 
      me on that score  let us sit down  you are to understand  miss 
      bennet  that i came here with the determined resolution of 
      carrying my purpose  nor will i be dissuaded from it  i have not 
      been used to submit to any person   s whims  i have not been in the 
      habit of brooking disappointment     
 
          that  will make your ladyship   s situation at present more 
      pitiable  but it will have no effect on  me      
 
         i will not be interrupted  hear me in silence  my daughter and 
      my nephew are formed for each other  they are descended  on the 
      maternal side  from the same noble line  and  on the father   s  
      from respectable  honourable  and ancient   though 
      untitled   families  their fortune on both sides is splendid  they 
      are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their 
      respective houses  and what is to divide them  the upstart 
      pretensions of a young woman without family  connections  or 
      fortune  is this to be endured  but it must not  shall not be  if 
      you were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit 
      the sphere in which you have been brought up     
 
         in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as 
      quitting that sphere  he is a gentleman  i am a gentleman   s 
      daughter  so far we are equal     
 
         true  you  are  a gentleman   s daughter  but who was your mother  
      who are your uncles and aunts  do not imagine me ignorant of 
      their condition     
 
         whatever my connections may be     said elizabeth     if your nephew 
      does not object to them  they can be nothing to  you      
 
         tell me once for all  are you engaged to him     
 
      though elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging lady 
      catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say  
      after a moment   s deliberation  
 
         i am not     
 
      lady catherine seemed pleased  
 
         and will you promise me  never to enter into such an 
      engagement     
 
         i will make no promise of the kind     
 
         miss bennet i am shocked and astonished  i expected to find a 
      more reasonable young woman  but do not deceive yourself into a 
      belief that i will ever recede  i shall not go away till you have 
      given me the assurance i require     
 
         and i certainly  never  shall give it  i am not to be 
      intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable  your ladyship 
      wants mr  darcy to marry your daughter  but would my giving you 
      the wished-for promise make  their  marriage at all more 
      probable  supposing him to be attached to me  would  my  refusing 
      to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin  
      allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which 
      you have supported this extraordinary application have been as 
      frivolous as the application was ill-judged  you have widely 
      mistaken my character  if you think i can be worked on by such 
      persuasions as these  how far your nephew might approve of your 
      interference in  his  affairs  i cannot tell  but you have 
      certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  i must beg  
      therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject     
 
         not so hasty  if you please  i have by no means done  to all the 
      objections i have already urged  i have still another to add  i 
      am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister   s 
      infamous elopement  i know it all  that the young man   s marrying 
      her was a patched-up business  at the expence of your father and 
      uncles  and is  such  a girl to be my nephew   s sister  is  her  
      husband  who is the son of his late father   s steward  to be his 
      brother  heaven and earth    of what are you thinking  are the 
      shades of pemberley to be thus polluted     
 
         you can  now  have nothing further to say     she resentfully 
      answered     you have insulted me in every possible method  i must 
      beg to return to the house     
 
      and she rose as she spoke  lady catherine rose also  and they 
      turned back  her ladyship was highly incensed  
 
         you have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my 
      nephew  unfeeling  selfish girl  do you not consider that a 
      connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody     
 
         lady catherine  i have nothing further to say  you know my 
      sentiments     
 
         you are then resolved to have him     
 
         i have said no such thing  i am only resolved to act in that 
      manner  which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness  
      without reference to  you   or to any person so wholly 
      unconnected with me     
 
         it is well  you refuse  then  to oblige me  you refuse to obey 
      the claims of duty  honour  and gratitude  you are determined to 
      ruin him in the opinion of all his friends  and make him the 
      contempt of the world     
 
         neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude     replied elizabeth  
         have any possible claim on me  in the present instance  no 
      principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr  
      darcy  and with regard to the resentment of his family  or the 
      indignation of the world  if the former  were  excited by his 
      marrying me  it would not give me one moment   s concern   and the 
      world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn     
 
         and this is your real opinion  this is your final resolve  very 
      well  i shall now know how to act  do not imagine  miss bennet  
      that your ambition will ever be gratified  i came to try you  i 
      hoped to find you reasonable  but  depend upon it  i will carry 
      my point     
 
      in this manner lady catherine talked on  till they were at the 
      door of the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added     i 
      take no leave of you  miss bennet  i send no compliments to your 
      mother  you deserve no such attention  i am most seriously 
      displeased     
 
      elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her 
      ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it 
      herself  she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up 
      stairs  her mother impatiently met her at the door of the 
      dressing-room  to ask why lady catherine would not come in again 
      and rest herself  
 
         she did not choose it     said her daughter     she would go     
 
         she is a very fine-looking woman  and her calling here was 
      prodigiously civil  for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the 
      collinses were well  she is on her road somewhere  i dare say  
      and so  passing through meryton  thought she might as well call 
      on you  i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you  
      lizzy     
 
      elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to 
      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 57 
 
      the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw 
      elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she  for 
      many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  lady 
      catherine  it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this 
      journey from rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her 
      supposed engagement with mr  darcy  it was a rational scheme  to 
      be sure  but from what the report of their engagement could 
      originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  till she 
      recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of bingley  and 
       her  being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the 
      expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to 
      supply the idea  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the 
      marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together  
      and her neighbours at lucas lodge  therefore  for through their 
      communication with the collinses  the report  she concluded  had 
      reached lady catherine   had only set  that  down as almost 
      certain and immediate  which  she  had looked forward to as 
      possible at some future time  
 
      in revolving lady catherine   s expressions  however  she could not 
      help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of 
      her persisting in this interference  from what she had said of 
      her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to 
      elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew  
      and how he might take a similar representation of the evils 
      attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce  she 
      knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his 
      dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he 
      thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it 
      was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with 
       one   whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  
      his aunt would address him on his weakest side  with his notions 
      of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to 
      elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good 
      sense and solid reasoning  
 
      if he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had 
      often seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a 
      relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to 
      be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him  in that case 
      he would return no more  lady catherine might see him in her way 
      through town  and his engagement to bingley of coming again to 
      netherfield must give way  
 
         if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come 
      to his friend within a few days     she added     i shall know how to 
      understand it  i shall then give over every expectation  every 
      wish of his constancy  if he is satisfied with only regretting 
      me  when he might have obtained my affections and hand  i shall 
      soon cease to regret him at all     
 
      the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their 
      visitor had been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied 
      it  with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs  
      bennet   s curiosity  and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on 
      the subject  
 
      the next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her 
      father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand  
 
         lizzy     said he     i was going to look for you  come into my 
      room     
 
      she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had 
      to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in 
      some manner connected with the letter he held  it suddenly struck 
      her that it might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated 
      with dismay all the consequent explanations  
 
      she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat 
      down  he then said  
 
         i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me 
      exceedingly  as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to 
      know its contents  i did not know before  that i had  two  
      daughters on the brink of matrimony  let me congratulate you on a 
      very important conquest     
 
      the colour now rushed into elizabeth   s cheeks in the 
      instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  
      instead of the aunt  and she was undetermined whether most to be 
      pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his 
      letter was not rather addressed to herself  when her father 
      continued  
 
         you look conscious  young ladies have great penetration in such 
      matters as these  but i think i may defy even  your  sagacity  to 
      discover the name of your admirer  this letter is from mr  
      collins     
 
         from mr  collins  and what can  he  have to say     
 
         something very much to the purpose of course  he begins with 
      congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest 
      daughter  of which  it seems  he has been told by some of the 
      good-natured  gossiping lucases  i shall not sport with your 
      impatience  by reading what he says on that point  what relates 
      to yourself  is as follows     having thus offered you the sincere 
      congratulations of mrs  collins and myself on this happy event  
      let me now add a short hint on the subject of another  of which 
      we have been advertised by the same authority  your daughter 
      elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet  
      after her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of 
      her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most 
      illustrious personages in this land     
 
         can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this     this young 
      gentleman is blessed  in a peculiar way  with every thing the 
      heart of mortal can most desire    splendid property  noble 
      kindred  and extensive patronage  yet in spite of all these 
      temptations  let me warn my cousin elizabeth  and yourself  of 
      what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this 
      gentleman   s proposals  which  of course  you will be inclined to 
      take immediate advantage of     
 
         have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is  but now it 
      comes out  
 
            my motive for cautioning you is as follows  we have reason to 
      imagine that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on 
      the match with a friendly eye     
 
          mr  darcy   you see  is the man  now  lizzy  i think i  have  
      surprised you  could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man 
      within the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have 
      given the lie more effectually to what they related  mr  darcy  
      who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish  and who 
      probably never looked at  you  in his life  it is admirable     
 
      elizabeth tried to join in her father   s pleasantry  but could 
      only force one most reluctant smile  never had his wit been 
      directed in a manner so little agreeable to her  
 
         are you not diverted     
 
         oh  yes  pray read on     
 
            after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her 
      ladyship last night  she immediately  with her usual 
      condescension  expressed what she felt on the occasion  when it 
      became apparent  that on the score of some family objections on 
      the part of my cousin  she would never give her consent to what 
      she termed so disgraceful a match  i thought it my duty to give 
      the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and her 
      noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run 
      hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned     
      mr  collins moreover adds     i am truly rejoiced that my cousin 
      lydia   s sad business has been so well hushed up  and am only 
      concerned that their living together before the marriage took 
      place should be so generally known  i must not  however  neglect 
      the duties of my station  or refrain from declaring my amazement 
      at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as 
      soon as they were married  it was an encouragement of vice  and 
      had i been the rector of longbourn  i should very strenuously 
      have opposed it  you ought certainly to forgive them  as a 
      christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their 
      names to be mentioned in your hearing      that  is his notion of 
      christian forgiveness  the rest of his letter is only about his 
      dear charlotte   s situation  and his expectation of a young 
      olive-branch  but  lizzy  you look as if you did not enjoy it  
      you are not going to be  missish   i hope  and pretend to be 
      affronted at an idle report  for what do we live  but to make 
      sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our turn     
 
         oh     cried elizabeth     i am excessively diverted  but it is so 
      strange     
 
         yes    that  is what makes it amusing  had they fixed on any other 
      man it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference  
      and  your  pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd  much 
      as i abominate writing  i would not give up mr  collins   s 
      correspondence for any consideration  nay  when i read a letter 
      of his  i cannot help giving him the preference even over 
      wickham  much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my 
      son-in-law  and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine about this 
      report  did she call to refuse her consent     
 
      to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as 
      it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not 
      distressed by his repeating it  elizabeth had never been more at 
      a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not  it was 
      necessary to laugh  when she would rather have cried  her father 
      had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of mr  darcy   s 
      indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want 
      of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too 
       little   she might have fancied too  much   
 
 
 
 
      chapter 58 
 
      instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  
      as elizabeth half expected mr  bingley to do  he was able to 
      bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed 
      after lady catherine   s visit  the gentlemen arrived early  and  
      before mrs  bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his 
      aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  bingley  who 
      wanted to be alone with jane  proposed their all walking out  it 
      was agreed to  mrs  bennet was not in the habit of walking  mary 
      could never spare time  but the remaining five set off together  
      bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip 
      them  they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy were 
      to entertain each other  very little was said by either  kitty 
      was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly 
      forming a desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the 
      same  
 
      they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call 
      upon maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a 
      general concern  when kitty left them she went boldly on with him 
      alone  now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and  
      while her courage was high  she immediately said  
 
         mr  darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of 
      giving relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be 
      wounding yours  i can no longer help thanking you for your 
      unexampled kindness to my poor sister  ever since i have known 
      it  i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully 
      i feel it  were it known to the rest of my family  i should not 
      have merely my own gratitude to express     
 
         i am sorry  exceedingly sorry     replied darcy  in a tone of 
      surprise and emotion     that you have ever been informed of what 
      may  in a mistaken light  have given you uneasiness  i did not 
      think mrs  gardiner was so little to be trusted     
 
         you must not blame my aunt  lydia   s thoughtlessness first 
      betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of 
      course  i could not rest till i knew the particulars  let me 
      thank you again and again  in the name of all my family  for that 
      generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble  
      and bear so many mortifications  for the sake of discovering 
      them     
 
         if you  will  thank me     he replied     let it be for yourself 
      alone  that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force 
      to the other inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to 
      deny  but your  family  owe me nothing  much as i respect them  i 
      believe i thought only of  you      
 
      elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  after a short 
      pause  her companion added     you are too generous to trifle with 
      me  if your feelings are still what they were last april  tell me 
      so at once   my  affections and wishes are unchanged  but one 
      word from you will silence me on this subject for ever     
 
      elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and 
      anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak  and 
      immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand 
      that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the 
      period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude 
      and pleasure his present assurances  the happiness which this 
      reply produced  was such as he had probably never felt before  
      and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as 
      warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  had 
      elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how 
      well the expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face  
      became him  but  though she could not look  she could listen  and 
      he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she 
      was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable  
 
      they walked on  without knowing in what direction  there was too 
      much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any 
      other objects  she soon learnt that they were indebted for their 
      present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who  did  
      call on him in her return through london  and there relate her 
      journey to longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her 
      conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on every 
      expression of the latter which  in her ladyship   s apprehension  
      peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief 
      that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that 
      promise from her nephew which  she  had refused to give  but  
      unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly 
      contrariwise  
 
         it taught me to hope     said he     as i had scarcely ever allowed 
      myself to hope before  i knew enough of your disposition to be 
      certain that  had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided 
      against me  you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine  
      frankly and openly     
 
      elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied     yes  you know 
      enough of my  frankness  to believe me capable of  that   after 
      abusing you so abominably to your face  i could have no scruple 
      in abusing you to all your relations     
 
         what did you say of me  that i did not deserve  for  though your 
      accusations were ill-founded  formed on mistaken premises  my 
      behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof  it 
      was unpardonable  i cannot think of it without abhorrence     
 
         we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to 
      that evening     said elizabeth     the conduct of neither  if 
      strictly examined  will be irreproachable  but since then  we 
      have both  i hope  improved in civility     
 
         i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself  the recollection of 
      what i then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions 
      during the whole of it  is now  and has been many months  
      inexpressibly painful to me  your reproof  so well applied  i 
      shall never forget     had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike 
      manner     those were your words  you know not  you can scarcely 
      conceive  how they have tortured me    though it was some time  i 
      confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice     
 
         i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong 
      an impression  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever 
      felt in such a way     
 
         i can easily believe it  you thought me then devoid of every 
      proper feeling  i am sure you did  the turn of your countenance i 
      shall never forget  as you said that i could not have addressed 
      you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me     
 
         oh  do not repeat what i then said  these recollections will not 
      do at all  i assure you that i have long been most heartily 
      ashamed of it     
 
      darcy mentioned his letter     did it     said he     did it soon make 
      you think better of me  did you  on reading it  give any credit 
      to its contents     
 
      she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually 
      all her former prejudices had been removed  
 
         i knew     said he     that what i wrote must give you pain  but it 
      was necessary  i hope you have destroyed the letter  there was 
      one part especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your 
      having the power of reading again  i can remember some 
      expressions which might justly make you hate me     
 
         the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential 
      to the preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason 
      to think my opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i 
      hope  quite so easily changed as that implies     
 
         when i wrote that letter     replied darcy     i believed myself 
      perfectly calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was 
      written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit     
 
         the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so  
      the adieu is charity itself  but think no more of the letter  the 
      feelings of the person who wrote  and the person who received it  
      are now so widely different from what they were then  that every 
      unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten  you 
      must learn some of my philosophy  think only of the past as its 
      remembrance gives you pleasure     
 
         i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind   your  
      retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the 
      contentment arising from them is not of philosophy  but  what is 
      much better  of innocence  but with  me   it is not so  painful 
      recollections will intrude which cannot  which ought not  to be 
      repelled  i have been a selfish being all my life  in practice  
      though not in principle  as a child i was taught what was 
       right   but i was not taught to correct my temper  i was given 
      good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit  
      unfortunately an only son  for many years an only  child    i was 
      spoilt by my parents  who  though good themselves  my father  
      particularly  all that was benevolent and amiable   allowed  
      encouraged  almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing  to 
      care for none beyond my own family circle  to think meanly of all 
      the rest of the world  to  wish  at least to think meanly of 
      their sense and worth compared with my own  such i was  from 
      eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been but 
      for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth  what do i not owe you  you 
      taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous  
      by you  i was properly humbled  i came to you without a doubt of 
      my reception  you showed me how insufficient were all my 
      pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased     
 
         had you then persuaded yourself that i should     
 
         indeed i had  what will you think of my vanity  i believed you 
      to be wishing  expecting my addresses     
 
         my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally  i 
      assure you  i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might 
      often lead me wrong  how you must have hated me after  that  
      evening     
 
         hate you  i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began 
      to take a proper direction     
 
         i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met 
      at pemberley  you blamed me for coming     
 
         no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise     
 
         your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed 
      by you  my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary 
      politeness  and i confess that i did not expect to receive  more  
      than my due     
 
         my object  then      replied darcy     was to show you  by every 
      civility in my power  that i was not so mean as to resent the 
      past  and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill 
      opinion  by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended 
      to  how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly 
      tell  but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you     
 
      he then told her of georgiana   s delight in her acquaintance  and 
      of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally 
      leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that 
      his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her 
      sister had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his 
      gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other 
      struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend  
 
      she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a 
      subject to each  to be dwelt on farther  
 
      after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy 
      to know anything about it  they found at last  on examining their 
      watches  that it was time to be at home  
 
         what could become of mr  bingley and jane     was a wonder which 
      introduced the discussion of  their  affairs  darcy was delighted 
      with their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest 
      information of it  
 
         i must ask whether you were surprised     said elizabeth  
 
         not at all  when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen     
 
         that is to say  you had given your permission  i guessed as 
      much     and though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had 
      been pretty much the case  
 
         on the evening before my going to london     said he     i made a 
      confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago  
      i told him of all that had occurred to make my former 
      interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent  his surprise 
      was great  he had never had the slightest suspicion  i told him  
      moreover  that i believed myself mistaken in supposing  as i had 
      done  that your sister was indifferent to him  and as i could 
      easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated  i felt 
      no doubt of their happiness together     
 
      elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing 
      his friend  
 
         did you speak from your own observation     said she     when you 
      told him that my sister loved him  or merely from my information 
      last spring     
 
         from the former  i had narrowly observed her during the two 
      visits which i had lately made here  and i was convinced of her 
      affection     
 
         and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate 
      conviction to him     
 
         it did  bingley is most unaffectedly modest  his diffidence had 
      prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case  
      but his reliance on mine made every thing easy  i was obliged to 
      confess one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended 
      him  i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had 
      been in town three months last winter  that i had known it  and 
      purposely kept it from him  he was angry  but his anger  i am 
      persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your 
      sister   s sentiments  he has heartily forgiven me now     
 
      elizabeth longed to observe that mr  bingley had been a most 
      delightful friend  so easily guided that his worth was 
      invaluable  but she checked herself  she remembered that he had 
      yet to learn to be laughed at  and it was rather too early to 
      begin  in anticipating the happiness of bingley  which of course 
      was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation 
      till they reached the house  in the hall they parted  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 59 
 
         my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to     was a 
      question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she 
      entered their room  and from all the others when they sat down to 
      table  she had only to say in reply  that they had wandered 
      about  till she was beyond her own knowledge  she coloured as she 
      spoke  but neither that  nor anything else  awakened a suspicion 
      of the truth  
 
      the evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary  
      the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged 
      were silent  darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness 
      overflows in mirth  and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather 
       knew  that she was happy than  felt  herself to be so  for  
      besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils 
      before her  she anticipated what would be felt in the family when 
      her situation became known  she was aware that no one liked him 
      but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a  dislike  
      which not all his fortune and consequence might do away  
 
      at night she opened her heart to jane  though suspicion was very 
      far from miss bennet   s general habits  she was absolutely 
      incredulous here  
 
         you are joking  lizzy  this cannot be    engaged to mr  darcy  no  
      no  you shall not deceive me  i know it to be impossible     
 
         this is a wretched beginning indeed  my sole dependence was on 
      you  and i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not  
      yet  indeed  i am in earnest  i speak nothing but the truth  he 
      still loves me  and we are engaged     
 
      jane looked at her doubtingly     oh  lizzy  it cannot be  i know 
      how much you dislike him     
 
         you know nothing of the matter   that  is all to be forgot  
      perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now  but in 
      such cases as these  a good memory is unpardonable  this is the 
      last time i shall ever remember it myself     
 
      miss bennet still looked all amazement  elizabeth again  and more 
      seriously assured her of its truth  
 
         good heaven  can it be really so  yet now i must believe you     
      cried jane     my dear  dear lizzy  i would   i do congratulate 
      you   but are you certain  forgive the question   are you quite 
      certain that you can be happy with him     
 
         there can be no doubt of that  it is settled between us already  
      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world  but are you 
      pleased  jane  shall you like to have such a brother     
 
         very  very much  nothing could give either bingley or myself 
      more delight  but we considered it  we talked of it as 
      impossible  and do you really love him quite well enough  oh  
      lizzy  do anything rather than marry without affection  are you 
      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do     
 
         oh  yes  you will only think i feel  more  than i ought to do  
      when i tell you all     
 
         what do you mean     
 
         why  i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley  i 
      am afraid you will be angry     
 
         my dearest sister  now  be  serious  i want to talk very 
      seriously  let me know every thing that i am to know  without 
      delay  will you tell me how long you have loved him     
 
         it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it 
      began  but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his 
      beautiful grounds at pemberley     
 
      another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the 
      desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn 
      assurances of attachment  when convinced on that article  miss 
      bennet had nothing further to wish  
 
         now i am quite happy     said she     for you will be as happy as 
      myself  i always had a value for him  were it for nothing but his 
      love of you  i must always have esteemed him  but now  as 
      bingley   s friend and your husband  there can be only bingley and 
      yourself more dear to me  but lizzy  you have been very sly  very 
      reserved with me  how little did you tell me of what passed at 
      pemberley and lambton  i owe all that i know of it to another  
      not to you     
 
      elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  she had been 
      unwilling to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own 
      feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend  but 
      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia   s 
      marriage  all was acknowledged  and half the night spent in 
      conversation  
 
         good gracious     cried mrs  bennet  as she stood at a window the 
      next morning     if that disagreeable mr  darcy is not coming here 
      again with our dear bingley  what can he mean by being so 
      tiresome as to be always coming here  i had no notion but he 
      would go a-shooting  or something or other  and not disturb us 
      with his company  what shall we do with him  lizzy  you must walk 
      out with him again  that he may not be in bingley   s way     
 
      elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal  
      yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him 
      such an epithet  
 
      as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  
      and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good 
      information  and he soon afterwards said aloud     mrs  bennet  
      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way 
      again to-day     
 
         i advise mr  darcy  and lizzy  and kitty     said mrs  bennet     to 
      walk to oakham mount this morning  it is a nice long walk  and 
      mr  darcy has never seen the view     
 
         it may do very well for the others     replied mr  bingley     but i 
      am sure it will be too much for kitty  won   t it  kitty     kitty 
      owned that she had rather stay at home  darcy professed a great 
      curiosity to see the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently 
      consented  as she went up stairs to get ready  mrs  bennet 
      followed her  saying  
 
         i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that 
      disagreeable man all to yourself  but i hope you will not mind 
      it  it is all for jane   s sake  you know  and there is no occasion 
      for talking to him  except just now and then  so  do not put 
      yourself to inconvenience     
 
      during their walk  it was resolved that mr  bennet   s consent 
      should be asked in the course of the evening  elizabeth reserved 
      to herself the application for her mother   s  she could not 
      determine how her mother would take it  sometimes doubting 
      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome 
      her abhorrence of the man  but whether she were violently set 
      against the match  or violently delighted with it  it was certain 
      that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her 
      sense  and she could no more bear that mr  darcy should hear the 
      first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her 
      disapprobation  
 
      in the evening  soon after mr  bennet withdrew to the library  
      she saw mr  darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on 
      seeing it was extreme  she did not fear her father   s opposition  
      but he was going to be made unhappy  and that it should be 
      through her means   that  she   his favourite child  should be 
      distressing him by her choice  should be filling him with fears 
      and regrets in disposing of her   was a wretched reflection  and 
      she sat in misery till mr  darcy appeared again  when  looking at 
      him  she was a little relieved by his smile  in a few minutes he 
      approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while 
      pretending to admire her work said in a whisper     go to your 
      father  he wants you in the library     she was gone directly  
 
      her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious  
         lizzy     said he     what are you doing  are you out of your 
      senses  to be accepting this man  have not you always hated him     
 
      how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been 
      more reasonable  her expressions more moderate  it would have 
      spared her from explanations and professions which it was 
      exceedingly awkward to give  but they were now necessary  and she 
      assured him  with some confusion  of her attachment to mr  darcy  
 
         or  in other words  you are determined to have him  he is rich  
      to be sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages 
      than jane  but will they make you happy     
 
         have you any other objection     said elizabeth     than your belief 
      of my indifference     
 
         none at all  we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of 
      man  but this would be nothing if you really liked him     
 
         i do  i do like him     she replied  with tears in her eyes     i 
      love him  indeed he has no improper pride  he is perfectly 
      amiable  you do not know what he really is  then pray do not pain 
      me by speaking of him in such terms     
 
         lizzy     said her father     i have given him my consent  he is the 
      kind of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse anything  
      which he condescended to ask  i now give it to  you   if you are 
      resolved on having him  but let me advise you to think better of 
      it  i know your disposition  lizzy  i know that you could be 
      neither happy nor respectable  unless you truly esteemed your 
      husband  unless you looked up to him as a superior  your lively 
      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal 
      marriage  you could scarcely escape discredit and misery  my 
      child  let me not have the grief of seeing  you  unable to 
      respect your partner in life  you know not what you are about     
 
      elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her 
      reply  and at length  by repeated assurances that mr  darcy was 
      really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change 
      which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute 
      certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had 
      stood the test of many months    suspense  and enumerating with 
      energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father   s 
      incredulity  and reconcile him to the match  
 
         well  my dear     said he  when she ceased speaking     i have no 
      more to say  if this be the case  he deserves you  i could not 
      have parted with you  my lizzy  to anyone less worthy     
 
      to complete the favourable impression  she then told him what mr  
      darcy had voluntarily done for lydia  he heard her with 
      astonishment  
 
         this is an evening of wonders  indeed  and so  darcy did every 
      thing  made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow   s 
      debts  and got him his commission  so much the better  it will 
      save me a world of trouble and economy  had it been your uncle   s 
      doing  i must and  would  have paid him  but these violent young 
      lovers carry every thing their own way  i shall offer to pay him 
      to-morrow  he will rant and storm about his love for you  and 
      there will be an end of the matter     
 
      he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his 
      reading mr  collins   s letter  and after laughing at her some 
      time  allowed her at last to go   saying  as she quitted the room  
         if any young men come for mary or kitty  send them in  for i am 
      quite at leisure     
 
      elizabeth   s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and  
      after half an hour   s quiet reflection in her own room  she was 
      able to join the others with tolerable composure  every thing was 
      too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away  
      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded  and the 
      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time  
 
      when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night  she 
      followed her  and made the important communication  its effect 
      was most extraordinary  for on first hearing it  mrs  bennet sat 
      quite still  and unable to utter a syllable  nor was it under 
      many  many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard  
      though not in general backward to credit what was for the 
      advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to 
      any of them  she began at length to recover  to fidget about in 
      her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself  
 
         good gracious  lord bless me  only think  dear me  mr  darcy  
      who would have thought it  and is it really true  oh  my sweetest 
      lizzy  how rich and how great you will be  what pin-money  what 
      jewels  what carriages you will have  jane   s is nothing to 
      it   nothing at all  i am so pleased   so happy  such a charming 
      man    so handsome  so tall    oh  my dear lizzy  pray apologise for 
      my having disliked him so much before  i hope he will overlook 
      it  dear  dear lizzy  a house in town  every thing that is 
      charming  three daughters married  ten thousand a year  oh  lord  
      what will become of me  i shall go distracted     
 
      this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be 
      doubted  and elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard 
      only by herself  soon went away  but before she had been three 
      minutes in her own room  her mother followed her  
 
         my dearest child     she cried     i can think of nothing else  ten 
      thousand a year  and very likely more     tis as good as a lord  
      and a special licence  you must and shall be married by a special 
      licence  but my dearest love  tell me what dish mr  darcy is 
      particularly fond of  that i may have it to-morrow     
 
      this was a sad omen of what her mother   s behaviour to the 
      gentleman himself might be  and elizabeth found that  though in 
      the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of 
      her relations    consent  there was still something to be wished 
      for  but the morrow passed off much better than she expected  for 
      mrs  bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law 
      that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power 
      to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his 
      opinion  
 
      elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains 
      to get acquainted with him  and mr  bennet soon assured her that 
      he was rising every hour in his esteem  
 
         i admire all my three sons-in-law highly     said he     wickham  
      perhaps  is my favourite  but i think i shall like  your  husband 
      quite as well as jane   s     
 
 
 
 
      chapter 60 
 
      elizabeth   s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted 
      mr  darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her  
         how could you begin     said she     i can comprehend your going on 
      charmingly  when you had once made a beginning  but what could 
      set you off in the first place     
 
         i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the 
      words  which laid the foundation  it is too long ago  i was in 
      the middle before i knew that i  had  begun     
 
         my beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners   my 
      behaviour to  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil  
      and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain 
      than not  now be sincere  did you admire me for my impertinence     
 
         for the liveliness of your mind  i did     
 
         you may as well call it impertinence at once  it was very little 
      less  the fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference  
      of officious attention  you were disgusted with the women who 
      were always speaking  and looking  and thinking for  your  
      approbation alone  i roused  and interested you  because i was so 
      unlike  them   had you not been really amiable  you would have 
      hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you took to disguise 
      yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and in your 
      heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously 
      courted you  there   i have saved you the trouble of accounting for 
      it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it 
      perfectly reasonable  to be sure  you knew no actual good of 
      me   but nobody thinks of  that  when they fall in love     
 
         was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while 
      she was ill at netherfield     
 
         dearest jane  who could have done less for her  but make a 
      virtue of it by all means  my good qualities are under your 
      protection  and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible  
      and  in return  it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing 
      and quarrelling with you as often as may be  and i shall begin 
      directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the 
      point at last  what made you so shy of me  when you first called  
      and afterwards dined here  why  especially  when you called  did 
      you look as if you did not care about me     
 
         because you were grave and silent  and gave me no 
      encouragement     
 
         but i was embarrassed     
 
         and so was i     
 
         you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner     
 
         a man who had felt less  might     
 
         how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give  
      and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it  but i wonder 
      how long you  would  have gone on  if you had been left to 
      yourself  i wonder when you  would  have spoken  if i had not 
      asked you  my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to 
      lydia had certainly great effect   too much   i am afraid  for 
      what becomes of the moral  if our comfort springs from a breach 
      of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the subject  this 
      will never do     
 
         you need not distress yourself  the moral will be perfectly 
      fair  lady catherine   s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us 
      were the means of removing all my doubts  i am not indebted for 
      my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your 
      gratitude  i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of 
      yours  my aunt   s intelligence had given me hope  and i was 
      determined at once to know every thing     
 
         lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her 
      happy  for she loves to be of use  but tell me  what did you come 
      down to netherfield for  was it merely to ride to longbourn and 
      be embarrassed  or had you intended any more serious 
      consequence     
 
         my real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if i could  
      whether i might ever hope to make you love me  my avowed one  or 
      what i avowed to myself  was to see whether your sister were 
      still partial to bingley  and if she were  to make the confession 
      to him which i have since made     
 
         shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what 
      is to befall her     
 
         i am more likely to want  time than courage  elizabeth  but it 
      ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it 
      shall be done directly     
 
         and if i had not a letter to write myself  i might sit by you 
      and admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady 
      once did  but i have an aunt  too  who must not be longer 
      neglected     
 
      from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr  
      darcy had been over-rated  elizabeth had never yet answered mrs  
      gardiner   s long letter  but now  having  that  to communicate 
      which she knew would be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to 
      find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of 
      happiness  and immediately wrote as follows  
 
         i would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as i ought to 
      have done  for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of 
      particulars  but to say the truth  i was too cross to write  you 
      supposed more than really existed  but  now  suppose as much as 
      you choose  give a loose rein to your fancy  indulge your 
      imagination in every possible flight which the subject will 
      afford  and unless you believe me actually married  you cannot 
      greatly err  you must write again very soon  and praise him a 
      great deal more than you did in your last  i thank you  again and 
      again  for not going to the lakes  how could i be so silly as to 
      wish it  your idea of the ponies is delightful  we will go round 
      the park every day  i am the happiest creature in the world  
      perhaps other people have said so before  but not one with such 
      justice  i am happier even than jane  she only smiles  i laugh  
      mr  darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare 
      from me  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas  yours  
      etc     
 
      mr  darcy   s letter to lady catherine was in a different style  
      and still different from either was what mr  bennet sent to mr  
      collins  in reply to his last  
 
         dear sir  
         i must trouble you once more for congratulations  elizabeth will 
      soon be the wife of mr  darcy  console lady catherine as well as 
      you can  but  if i were you  i would stand by the nephew  he has 
      more to give  
 
         yours sincerely  etc     
 
      miss bingley   s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching 
      marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  she wrote 
      even to jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat 
      all her former professions of regard  jane was not deceived  but 
      she was affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could 
      not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was 
      deserved  
 
      the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar 
      information  was as sincere as her brother   s in sending it  four 
      sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight  and 
      all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister  
 
      before any answer could arrive from mr  collins  or any 
      congratulations to elizabeth from his wife  the longbourn family 
      heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge  the 
      reason of this sudden removal was soon evident  lady catherine 
      had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her 
      nephew   s letter  that charlotte  really rejoicing in the match  
      was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over  at such a 
      moment  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to 
      elizabeth  though in the course of their meetings she must 
      sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she saw mr  
      darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her 
      husband  he bore it  however  with admirable calmness  he could 
      even listen to sir william lucas  when he complimented him on 
      carrying away the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed 
      his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st  james   s  with 
      very decent composure  if he did shrug his shoulders  it was not 
      till sir william was out of sight  
 
      mrs  phillips   s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax 
      on his forbearance  and though mrs  phillips  as well as her 
      sister  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the 
      familiarity which bingley   s good humour encouraged  yet  whenever 
      she  did  speak  she must be vulgar  nor was her respect for him  
      though it made her more quiet  at all likely to make her more 
      elegant  elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the 
      frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep him to 
      herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse 
      without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings 
      arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of 
      its pleasure  it added to the hope of the future  and she looked 
      forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from 
      society so little pleasing to either  to all the comfort and 
      elegance of their family party at pemberley  
 
 
 
 
      chapter 61 
 
      happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs  
      bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters  with what 
      delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs  bingley  and talked 
      of mrs  darcy  may be guessed  i wish i could say  for the sake 
      of her family  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in 
      the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an 
      effect as to make her a sensible  amiable  well-informed woman 
      for the rest of her life  though perhaps it was lucky for her 
      husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so 
      unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and 
      invariably silly  
 
      mr  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection 
      for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do  
      he delighted in going to pemberley  especially when he was least 
      expected  
 
      mr  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth  
      so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not 
      desirable even to  his  easy temper  or  her  affectionate heart  
      the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified  he bought an 
      estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire  and jane and 
      elizabeth  in addition to every other source of happiness  were 
      within thirty miles of each other  
 
      kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her 
      time with her two elder sisters  in society so superior to what 
      she had generally known  her improvement was great  she was not 
      of so ungovernable a temper as lydia  and  removed from the 
      influence of lydia   s example  she became  by proper attention and 
      management  less irritable  less ignorant  and less insipid  from 
      the further disadvantage of lydia   s society she was of course 
      carefully kept  and though mrs  wickham frequently invited her to 
      come and stay with her  with the promise of balls and young men  
      her father would never consent to her going  
 
      mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was 
      necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs  
      bennet   s being quite unable to sit alone  mary was obliged to mix 
      more with the world  but she could still moralize over every 
      morning visit  and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons 
      between her sisters    beauty and her own  it was suspected by her 
      father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance  
 
      as for wickham and lydia  their characters suffered no revolution 
      from the marriage of her sisters  he bore with philosophy the 
      conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with 
      whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown 
      to her  and in spite of every thing  was not wholly without hope 
      that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune  the 
      congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her 
      marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  if not by 
      himself  such a hope was cherished  the letter was to this 
      effect  
 
         my dear lizzy  
         i wish you joy  if you love mr  darcy half as well as i do my 
      dear wickham  you must be very happy  it is a great comfort to 
      have you so rich  and when you have nothing else to do  i hope 
      you will think of us  i am sure wickham would like a place at 
      court very much  and i do not think we shall have quite money 
      enough to live upon without some help  any place would do  of 
      about three or four hundred a year  but however  do not speak to 
      mr  darcy about it  if you had rather not  
 
         yours  etc     
 
      as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not  she 
      endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and 
      expectation of the kind  such relief  however  as it was in her 
      power to afford  by the practice of what might be called economy 
      in her own private expences  she frequently sent them  it had 
      always been evident to her that such an income as theirs  under 
      the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants  and 
      heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to their 
      support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either jane or 
      herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance 
      towards discharging their bills  their manner of living  even 
      when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was 
      unsettled in the extreme  they were always moving from place to 
      place in quest of a cheap situation  and always spending more 
      than they ought  his affection for her soon sunk into 
      indifference  hers lasted a little longer  and in spite of her 
      youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to reputation 
      which her marriage had given her  
 
      though darcy could never receive  him  at pemberley  yet  for 
      elizabeth   s sake  he assisted him further in his profession  
      lydia was occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone 
      to enjoy himself in london or bath  and with the bingleys they 
      both of them frequently staid so long  that even bingley   s good 
      humour was overcome  and he proceeded so far as to  talk  of 
      giving them a hint to be gone  
 
      miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy   s marriage  but 
      as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at 
      pemberley  she dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of 
      georgiana  almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore  and paid 
      off every arrear of civility to elizabeth  
 
      pemberley was now georgiana   s home  and the attachment of the 
      sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see  they were able 
      to love each other even as well as they intended  georgiana had 
      the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth  though at first 
      she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her 
      lively  sportive  manner of talking to her brother  he  who had 
      always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her 
      affection  she now saw the object of open pleasantry  her mind 
      received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way  by 
      elizabeth   s instructions  she began to comprehend that a woman 
      may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not 
      always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than 
      himself  
 
      lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her 
      nephew  and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her 
      character in her reply to the letter which announced its 
      arrangement  she sent him language so very abusive  especially of 
      elizabeth  that for some time all intercourse was at an end  but 
      at length  by elizabeth   s persuasion  he was prevailed on to 
      overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation  and  after a 
      little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her resentment 
      gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity to 
      see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait 
      on them at pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods 
      had received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress  
      but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city  
 
      with the gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms  
      darcy  as well as elizabeth  really loved them  and they were 
      both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons 
      who  by bringing her into derbyshire  had been the means of 
      uniting them
