extracts 
 supplied by a sub-sub-librarian  

it will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and 
grub -worm of a poor devil of a sub -sub appears to have gone 
through the long vaticans and street-stalls of the earth  pick- 
ing up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways 
find in any book whatsoever  sacred or profane  therefore 
you must not  in every case at least  take the higgledy-piggledy 
whale statements  however authentic  in these extracts  for 
veritable gospel cetology  far from it  as touching the 
ancient authors generally  as well as the poets here appearing  
these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining  as affording 
a glancing bird s-eye view of what has been promiscuously 
said  thought  fancied  and sung of leviathan  by many 
nations and generations  including our own  

so fare thee well  poor devil of a sub-sub  whose commen- 
tator i am  thou belongest to that hopeless  sallow tribe 
which no wine of this world will ever warm   and for whom 
even pale sherry would be too rosy-strong   but with whom 
one sometimes loves to sit  and feel poor-devilish  too   and 
grow convivial upon tears   and say to them bluntly with full 
eyes and empty glasses  and in not altogether unpleasant 
sadness give it up  sub-subs   for by how much the more 
pains ye take to please the world  by so much the more shall 
ye forever go thankless   would that i could clear out 
hampton court and the tuileries for ye   but gulp down 
your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts   
for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the 
seven-storied heavens  and making refugees of long-pampered 
gabriel  michael  and raphael  against your coming  here 
ye strike but splintered hearts together there  ye shall 
strike unsplinterable glasses

call me ishmael  some years ago never mind how 
long precisely having little or no money in my purse  
and nothing particular to interest me on shore  i thought 
i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the 
world  it is a way i have of driving off the spleen  and 
regulating the circulation  whenever i find myself 
growing grim about the mouth   whenever it is a damp  
drizzly november in my soul   whenever i find myself 
involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses  and bring- 
ing up the rear of every funeral i meet   and especially 
whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me  that 
it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from 
deliberately stepping into the street  and methodically 
knocking people s hats off then  i account it high time 
to get to sea as soon as i can  this is my substitute for 
pistol and ball  with a philosophical flourish cato throws 
himself upon his sword   i quietly take to the ship  
there is nothing surprising in this  if they but knew 
it  almost all men in their degree  some time or other  
cherish very nearly the same feelings toward the ocean 
with me  

there now is your insular city of the manhattoes  
belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs 
commerce surrounds it with her surf  right and left  the 
streets take you waterward  its extreme down -town is the

cooled by breezes  which a few hours previous were out of 
sight of land  look at the crowds of water -gazers there  

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath after- 
noon  go from corlears hook to coenties slip  and 
from thence  by whitehall  northward  what do you 
see   posted like silent sentinels all around the town  
stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed 
in ocean reveries  some leaning against the spiles   
some seated upon the pier-heads   some looking over 
vhe bulwarks of ships from china   some high aloft in 
the rigging  as if striving to get a still better seaward 
peep  but these are all landsmen   of week days pent 
up in lath and plaster tied to counters  nailed to benches  
clinched to desks  how then is this   are the green 
fields gone   what do they here   

but look   here come more crowds  pacing straight for 
the water  and seemingly bound for a dive  strange   
nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the 
land   loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses 
will not suffice  no  they must get just as nigh the 
water as they possibly can without falling in  and there 
they stand miles of them leagues  inlanders all  they 
come from lanes and alleys  streets and avenues north  
east  south  and west  yet here they all unite  tell me  
does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses 
of all those ships attract them thither   

once more  say  you are in the country   in some 
high land of lakes  take almost any path you please  
and ten to one it carries you down in a dale  and leaves 
you there by a pool in the stream  there is magic in it  
let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his 
deepest reveries stand that man on his legs  set his feet 
a-going  and he will infallibly lead you to water  if water 
there be in all that region  should you ever be athirst

caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical 
professor  yes  as everyone knows  meditation andli 
water are wedded forever  

but here is an artist  he desires to paint you the 
dreamiest  shadiest  quietest  most enchanting bit of 
romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco  what 
is the chief element he employs   there stand his trees  
each with a hollow trunk  as if a hermit and a crucifix 
were within   and here sleeps his meadow  and there sleep 
his cattle   and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy 
smoke  deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way  
reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in 
their hillside blue  but though the picture lies thus 
tranced  and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs 
like leaves upon this shepherd s head  yet all were 
vain  unless the shepherd s eye were fixed upon the 
magic stream before him  go visit the prairies in june  
when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee -deep 
among tiger-lilies what is the one charm wanting  - 
water there is not a drop of water there   were niagara 
but a cataract of sand  would you travel your thousand 
miles to see it   why did the poor poet of tennessee  
upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver  deliberate 
whether to buy him a coat  which he sadly needed  or 
invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach   
why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust 
healthy soul in him  at some time or other crazy to go to 
sea   why upon your first voyage as a passenger  did 
you yourself feel such a mystical vibration  when first   
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of   
land   why did the old persians hold the sea holy   
why did the greeks give it a separate deity  and own 
brother of jove   surely all this is not without meaning  
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus  
who because he could not grasp the tormenting  mild

image he saw in the fountain  plunged into it and was 
drowned  but that same image  we ourselves see in all 
rivers and oceans  it is the image of the ungraspable 
phantom of life   and this is the key to it all  

now  when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea 
whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes  and begin 
to be over conscious of my lungs  i do not mean to have 
it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger  for to 
go as a passenger you must needs have a purse  and a 
purse is but a rag unless you have something in it  be- 
sides  passengers get sea-sick grow quarrelsome don t 
sleep of nights do not enjoy themselves much  as a 
general thing   no  i never go as a passenger   nor  
though i am something of a salt  do i ever go to sea as a 
commodore  or a captain  or a cook  i abandon the 
glory and distinction of such offices to those who like 
them  for my part  i abominate all honourable respect- 
able toils  trials  and tribulations of every kind what- 
soever  it is quite as much as i can do to take care 
of myself  without taking care of ships  barques  brigs  
schooners  and what not  and as for going as cook  
though i confess there is considerable glory in that  a 
cook being a sort of officer on shipboard yet  somehow  
i never fancied broiling fowls   though once broiled  
judiciously buttered  and judgmatically salted and 
peppered  there is no one who will speak more respect- 
fully  not to say reverentially  of a broiled fowl than i 
will  it is out of the idolatrous do tings of the old 
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse  that 
you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge 
bake-houses the pyramids  

no  when i go to sea  i go as a simple sailor  right 
before the mast  plumb down into the forecastle  aloft 
there to the royal mast-head  true  they rather order 
me about some  and make me jump from spar to spar  



loomings 5 

like a grasshopper in a may meadow  and at first  this 
sort of thing is unpleasant enough  it touches one s 
sense of honour  particularly if you come of an old estab- 
lished family in the land  the van rensselaers  or ran- 
dolphs  or hardicanutes  and more than all  if just 
previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot  you have 
been lording it as a country schoolmaster  making the 
tallest boys stand in awe of you  the transition is a 
keen one  i assure you  from a schoolmaster to a sailor  
and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics 
to enable you to grin and bear it  but even this wears 
off hi time  

what of it  if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders 
me to get a broom and sweep down the decks   what 
does that indignity amount to  weighed  i mean  in the 
scales of the new testament   do you think the arch- 
angel gabriel thinks anything the less of me  because i 
promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that 
particular instance   who ain t a slave   tell me that  
well  then  however the old sea -captains may order me 
about however they may thump and punch me about  
i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right   
that everybody else is one way or other served in much the 
same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of 
view  that is   and so the universal thump is passed 
round  and all hands should rub each other s shoulder- 
blades  and be content  

again  i always go to sea as a sailor  because they make 
a point of paying me for my trouble  whereas they never 
pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of  on 
the contrary  passengers themselves must pay  and 
there is all the difference in the world between paying 
and being paid  the act of paying is perhaps the most 
uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves 
entailed upon us  but being paid  what will compare

with it   the urbane activity with which a man receives 
money is really marvellous  considering that we so 
earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills  
and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven  
ah   how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition   

finally  i always go to sea as a sailor  because of the 
wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck  
for as in this world  head-winds are far more prevalent 
than winds from astern  that is  if you never violate 
the pythagorean maxim   so for the most part the com- 
modore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at 
second hand from the sailors on the forecastle  he thinks 
he breathes it first   but not so  in much the same 
way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other 
things  at the same time that the leaders little suspect it  
but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt 
the sea as a merchant sailor  i should now take it into 
my head to go on a whaling voyage   this the invisible 
police-officer of the fates  who has the constant surveil- 
lance of me  and secretly dogs me  and influences me in 
some unaccountable way he can better answer than any 
one else  and  doubtless  my going on this whaling 
voyage formed part of the grand programme of provi- 
dence that was drawn up a long time ago  it came in 
as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more exten- 
sive performances  i take it that this part of the bill 
must have run something like this   

  grand contested election for the presidency of the 
united states  

  whaling voyage by one ishmael

though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those 
stage managers  the fates  put me down for this shabby 



loomings 7 

part of a whaling voyage  when others were set down 
for magnificent parts in high tragedies  and short and easy 
parts in genteel comedies  and jolly parts in farces 
though i cannot tell why this was exactly   yet  now that 
i recall all the circumstances  i think i can see a little 
into the springs and motives which  being cunningly 
presented to me under various disguises  induced me to 
set about performing the part i did  besides cajoling me 
into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my 
own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment  

chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea 
of the great whale himself  such a gortentous and 
mysterious monster roused all my curiosity  then the 
wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk   
the undeliverable  nameless perils of the whale   these  
with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian 
sights and sounds  helped to sway me to my wish  with 
other men  perhaps  such things would not have been 
inducements   but as for me  i am tormented with an 
everlasting itch for things remote  i love to sail for- 
bidden seas  and land on barbarous coasts  not ignoring 
what is good  i am quick to perceive a horror  and could 
still be social with it would they let me since it is 
but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of 
the place one lodges in  

by reason of these things  then  the whaling voyage 
was welcome   the great flood-gates of the wonder-world 
swung open  and in the wild conceits that swayed me to 
my purpose  two and two there floated into my inmost 
soul  endless processions of the whale  and  midmost of 
them all  one grand hooded phantom  like a snow hill in 
the air  



chapter ii 

the carpet-bag 

i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag  tucked 
it under my arm  and started for cape horn and the 
pacific  quitting the good city of old manhatto  i duly 
arrived in new bedford  it was on a saturday night in 
december  much was i disappointed upon learning 
that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed  
and that no way of reaching that place would offer  till 
the following monday  

as most young candidates for the pains and penalties 
of whaling stop at this same new bedford  thence to 
embark on their voyage  it may as well be related that i 5 
for one  had no idea of so doing  for my mind was made 
up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft  because 
there was a fine  boisterous something about everything 
connected with that famous old island  which amazingly 
pleased me  besides  though new bedford has of late 
been gradually monopolising the business of whaling  and 
though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much 
behind her  yet nantucket was her great original the 
tyre of this carthage   the place where the first dead 
american whale was stranded  where else but from 
nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen  the red men  
first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan   
and where but from nantucket  too  did that first adven- 
turous little sloop put forth  partly laden with imported 
cobble-stones so goes the story to throw at the whales  



the carpet-bag 9 

in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk 
a harpoon from the bowsprit   

now having a night  a day  and still another night 
following before me in new bedford  ere i could embark 
for my destined port  it became a matter of concernment 
where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile  it was a very 
dubious-looking  nay  a very dark and dismal night  
bitingly cold and cheerless  i knew no one in the place  
with anxious grapnelsje had sounded my pocket  and only 
brought up a few pieces of silver  so  wherever you go  
ishmael  said i to myself  as i stood in the middle of a 
dreary street shouldering my bag  and comparing the 
gloom toward the north with the darkness toward the 
south wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to 
lodge for the night  my dear ishmael  be sure to inquire 
the price  and don t be too particular  

with halting steps i paced the streets  and passed the 
sign of  the crossed harpoons   but it looked too expen- 
sive and jolly there  further on  from the bright red 
windows of the   sword-fish inn   there came such fer- 
vent rays  that it seemed to have melted the packed snow 
and ice from before the house  for everywhere else the 
congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard  asphaltic 
pavement  rather weary for me  when i struck my foot 
against the flinty projections  because from hard  remorse- 
less service the soles of mv boots were in a most miserable 

v 

plight  too expensive and jolly  again thought i  pausing 
one moment to watch the broad glare in the street  and 
hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within  but go i 
on  ishmael  said i at last   don t you hear   get away l 
from before the door   your patched boots are stopping 
the way  so on i went  i now by instinct followed the 
streets that took me waterward  for there  doubtless  
were the cheapest  if not the cheeriest inns  

such dreary streets   blocks of blackness  not houses

on either hand  and here and there a candle  like a candle 
moving about in a tomb  at this hour of the night  of 
the last day of the week  that quarter of the town proved 
all but deserted  but presently i carne to a smoky 
light proceeding from a low  wide building  the door of 
which stood invitingly open  it had a careless look  as 
if it were meant for the uses of the public   so  entering  
the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash-box in 
the porch  ha   thought i  ha  as the flying particles 
almost choked me  are these ashes from that destroyed 
city  gomorrah   but   the cfossed harpoons   and 
4 the sword-fish     this  then  must needs be the sign 
of   the trap    however  i picked myself up   and hearing 
a loud voice within  pushed on and opened a second  
interior door  

it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet  
a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer   
and beyond  a black angel of doom was beating a book 
in a pulpit  it was a negro church   and the preacher s 
text was about the blackness of darkness  and the weep- 
ing and wailing and teeth -gnashing there  ha  ishmael  
muttered i  backing out  wretched entertainment at the 
sign of   the trap     

moving on  i at last came to a dim sort of light not far 
from the docks  and heard a forlorn creaking in the air   
and looking up  saw a swinging sign over the door with 
a white painting upon it  faintly representing a tall straight 
jet of misty spray  and these words underneath   the 
spouter-inn   peter coffin   

coffin   spouter   rather ominous in that particu- 
lar connection  thought i  but it is a common name in 
nantucket  they say  and i suppose this peter here is an 
emigrant from there  as the light looked so dim  and 
the place  for the time  looked quiet enough  and the 
dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might 



the carpet-bag 11 

have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt dis- 
trict  and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort 
of creak to it  i thought that here was the very spot for 
cheap lodgings  and the best of pea-coffee  

it was a queer sort of place a gable-ended old house  
one side palsied as it were  and leaning over sadly  it 
stood on a sharp bleak corner  where that tempestuous 
wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it 
did about poor paul s tossed craft  euroclydon  never- 
theless  is a mighty pleasant zephyr to anyone indoors  
with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed  4 in 
judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon   
says an old writer of whose works i possess the only 
copy extant   it maketh a marvellous difference  
whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where 
the frost is all on the outside  or whether thou observest 
it from that cashless window  where the frost is on both 
sides  and of which the wight death is the only glazier   
true enough  thought i  as this passage occurred to my 
mind old black-letter  thou reasonest well  yes  these 
eyes are windows  and this body of mine is the house  
what a pity they didn t stop up the chinks and the 
crannies though  and thrust in a little lint here and there  
but it  s too late to make any improvements now  the 
universe is finished   the cope-stone is on  and the chips 
were carted off a million years ago  poor lazarus there  
chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow  
and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings  he might 
plug up both ears with rags  and put a corn-cob into his 
mouth  and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous 
euroclydon  euroclydon   says old dives  in his red 
silken wrapper  he had a redder one afterward  pooh  
pooh   what a fine frosty night   how orion glitters   
what northern lights   let them talk of their oriental 
summer climes of everlasting conservatories   give me

the privilege of making my own summer with my own 
coals  

but what thinks lazarus   can he warm his blue 
hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights   
would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here   
would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along 
the line of the equator   yea  ye gods   go down to the 
fiery pit itself  in order to keep out this frost   

now  that lazarus should lie stranded there on the 
curbstone before the door of dives  this is more wonderful 
than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the 
moluccas  yet dives himself  he too lives like a czar 
in an ice-palace made of frozen sighs  and being a president 
of a temperance society  he only drinks the tepid tears of 
orphans  

but no more of this blubbering now  we are going a- 
whaling  and there is plenty of that yet to come  let 
us scrape the ice from our frosted feet  and see what sort 
of a place this   spouter   may be

the spottter-inn 

entering that gable -ended spouter-inn  you found 
yourself in a wide  low  straggling entry with old-fashioned 
wainscots  reminding one of the bulwarks of some con- 
demned old craft  on one side hung a very large oil- 
painting so thoroughly besmoked  and every way defaced  
that in the unequal cross-lights by which you viewed it  
it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic 
visits to it  and careful inquiry of the neighbours  that 
you could any way arrive at an understanding of its 
purpose  such unaccountable masses of shades and 
shadows  that at first you almost thought some ambitious 
young artist  in the time of the new england hags  had 
endeavoured to delineate chaos bewitched  but by dint 
of much and earnest contemplation  and oft-repeated 
ponderings  and especially by throwing open the little 
window toward the back of the entry  you at last come 
to the conclusion that such an idea  however wild  might 
not be altogether unwarranted  

but what most puzzled and confounded you was a 
long  limber  portentous  black mass of something hover- 
ing in the centre of the picture over three blue  dim  
perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast  a boggy  
soggy  squitchy picture truly  enough to drive a nervous 
man distracted  yet there was a sort of indefinite  half- 
attained  unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly 
froze you to it  till you in voluntarily  took an oath with 
yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant  

is

ever and anon a bright  but  alas  deceptive idea would 
dart you through  it  s the black sea in a midnight gale  
it  s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements  
it  s a blasted heath  it  s a hyperborean winter scene  
it  s the breaking-up of the ice-bound stream of time  
but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous 
something in the picture s midst  that once found out  
and all the rest were plain  but stop   does it not bear 
a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish   even the great 
leviathan himself   

in fact  the artist s design seemed this   a final theory 
of my own  partly based upon the aggregated opinions 
of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the 
subject  the picture represents a cape-horner in a great 
hurricane   the half-foundered ship weltering there with 
its three dismantled masts alone visible   and an exasper- 
ated whale  purposing to spring clean over the craft  is 
in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three 
mast-heads  

the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with 
a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears  some 
were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory 
saws   others were tufted with knots of human hair   and 
one was sickle-shaped  with a vast handle sweeping round 
like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long- 
armed mower  you shuddered as you gazed  and 
wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could 
ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking  
horrifying implement  mixed with these were rusty 
old whaling-lances and harpoons all broken and deformed  
some were storied weapons  with this once long lance  
now wildly elbowed  fifty years ago did nathan swain 
kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset  and 
that harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in 
javan seas  and run away with by a whale  years after-

crossing this dusky entry  and on through yon low- 
arched way cut through what in old times must have 
been a great central chimney with fire-places all round 
you enter the public room  a still duskier place is this  
with such low ponderous beams above  and such old 
wrinkled planks beneath  that you would almost fancy 
you trod some old craft s cockpits  especially of such a 
howling night  when this corner-anchored old ark rocked 
so furiously  on one side stood a long  low  shelf-like 
table covered with cracked glass cases  filled with dusty 
rarities gathered from this wide world s remotest nooks  
projecting from the further angle of the room stands a 
dark-looking den the bar a rude attempt at a right 
whale s head  be that how it may  there stands the vast 
arched bone of the whale s jaw  so wide  a coach might 
almost drive beneath it  within are shabby shelves  
ranged round with old decanters  bottles  flasks   and in 
those jaws of swift destruction  like another cursed jonah 
 by which name indeed they called him   bustles a little 
withered old man  who  for their money  dearly sells the 
sailors deliriums and death  

abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his 
poison  though true cylinders without within  the 
villainous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered down-

pecked into the glass  surround these footpads  goblets

divers speiimens of skrimshander  i sought the land- 
lord  and telling him i desired to be accommodated with 
a room  received for answer that his house was full not 
a bed unoccupied    but avast  5 he added  tapping his 
forehead    you hain t no objections to sharin  a har- 
pooneer  s blanket  have ye   i s pose you are goin  a- 
whalin 5   so you  d better get used to that sort of thing  5 

i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed   that 
if i should ever do so  it would depend upon who the 
harpooneer might be  and that if he  the landlord  really 
had no other place for me  and the harpooneer was not 
decidedly objectionable  why  rather than wander further 
about a strange town on so bitter a night  i would put 
up with the half of any decent man 5 s blanket  

  i thought so  all right   take a seat  supper   
you want supper   supper 5 11 be ready directly  5 

i sat down on an old wooden settle  carved all over like 
a bench on the battery  at one end a ruminating tar 
was still further adorning it with his jack-knife  stooping 
over and diligently working away at the space between 
his legs  he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail  
but he didn t make much headway  i thought  

at last some four or five of us were summoned to our 
meal in an adjoining room  it was cold as iceland 
no fire at all the landlord said he couldn t afford it  
nothing but two dismal tallow candles  each in a winding 
sheet  we were fain to button up our monkey-jackets  
and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half- 
frozen fingers  but the fare was of the most substantial 
kind not only meat and potatoes  but dumplings   good 
heavens   dumplings for supper   one young fellow in 
a green box-coat addressed himself to these dumplings 
hi a most direful manner  

  my boy   said the landlord    you  11 have the night- 
mare to a dead sartainty

 landlord   i whispered  w that ain t the harpooneer  
is it     

1 oh  no  said he  looking a sort of diabolically funny  
4 the harpooneer is a dark - complexioned chap  he 
never eats dumplings  he don t he eats nothing but 
steaks  and likes  em rare   

  the devil he does    says i    where is that harpooneer   
is he here     

  he  11 be here afore long   was the answer  

i could not help it  but i began to feel suspicious of 
this   dark-complexioned   harpooneer  at any rate  i 
made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should 
sleep together  he must undress and get into bed before 
i did  

supper over  the company went back to the bar-room  
when  knowing not what else to do with myself  i resolved 
to spend the rest of the evening as a looker-on  

presently a rioting noise was heard without  starting 
up  the landlord cried    that  s the grampus s crew  i 
seed her reported in the offing this morning   a three 
years  voyage  and a full ship  hurrah  boys   now we  11 
have the latest news from the feegees   

a tramping of sea-boots was heard in the entry   the 
door was flung open  and in rolled a wild set of mariners 
enough  enveloped in their shaggy watch-coats  and 
with their heads muffled in woollen comforters  all be- 
darned and ragged  and their beards stiff with icicles  
they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador  they 
had just landed from their boat  and this was the first 
house they entered  no wonder  then  that they made 
a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when 
the wrinkled little old jonah  there officiating  soon 
poured them out brimmers all round  one complained 
of a bad cold in his head  upon which jonah mixed 
him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses  which he

swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs 
whatsoever  never mind of how long standing  or whether 
caught off the coast of labrador  or on the weather-side 
of an ice -island  

the liquor soon mounted into their heads  as it 
generally does even with the arrantest topers newly 
landed from sea  and they began capering about most 
obstreperously  

i observed  however  that one of them held somewhat 
aloof  and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the 
hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face  yet upon 
the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the 
rest  this man interested me at once   and since the sea- 
gods had ordained that he should soon become my ship- 
mate  though but a sleeping-partner one  so far as this 
narrative is concerned   i will here venture upon a little 
description of him  he stood full six feet in height  with 
noble shoulders  and a chest like a coffer-dam  i have 
seldom seen such brawn in a man  his face was deeply 
brown and burnt  making his white teeth dazzling by the 
contrast   while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated 
some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much 
joy  his voice at once announced that he was a 
southerner  and from his fine stature  i thought he must 
be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian 
ridge in virginia  when the revelry of his companions 
had mounted to its height  this man slipped away unob- 
served  and i saw no more of him till he became my 
comrade on the sea  in a few minutes  however  he was 
missed by his shipmates  and being  it seems  for some 
reason a huge favourite with them  they raised a cry of 
  bulkington   bulkington   where 5 s bulkington     and 
darted out of the house in pursuit of him  

it was now about nine o clock  and the room seeming 
almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies  i began 



the spouter-inn 19 

to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred 
to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen  

no man prefers to sleep two in a bed  in fact  you 
would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother  
i don t know how it is  but people like to be private when 
they are sleeping  and when it comes to sleeping with 
an unknown stranger  in a strange inn  in a strange town  
and that stranger a harpooneer  then your objections 
indefinitely multiply  nor was there any earthly reason 
why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed  more than 
anybody else   for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at 
sea  than bachelor kings do ashore  to be sure  they 
all sleep together in one apartment  but you have your 
own hammock  and cover yourself with your own blanket  
and sleep in your own skin  

the more i pondered over this harpooneer  the more i 
abominated the thought of sleeping with him  it was 
fair to presume that being a harpooneer  his linen or 
woollen  as the case might be  would not be of the tidiest  
certainly none of the finest  i began to twitch all over  
besides  it was getting late  and my decent harpooneer 
ought to be home and going bedward  suppose now  
he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i 
tell from what vile hole he had been coming   

  landlord   i ve changed my mind about that 
harpooneer  i shan t sleep with him  i  11 try the bench 
here   

  just as you please   i  m sorry i can t spare ye a 
tablecloth for a mattress  and it  s a plaguy rough board 
here   feeling of the knots and notches    but wait 
a bit  skrimshander   i ve got a carpenter s plane there 
in the bar wait  i say  and i  11 make ye snug enough   
so saying he procured the plane   and with his old silk 
handkerchief first dusting the bench  vigorously set to 
planing away at my bed  the while grinning like an ape  



20 moby-dick 

the shavings flew right and left   till at last the plane- 
iron came bump against an indestructible knot  the 
landlord was near spraining his wrist  and i told him for 
heaven s sake to quit the bed was soft enough to suit 
me  and i did not know how all the planing in the world 
could make eider down of a pine plank  so gathering 
up the shavings with another grin  and throwing them 
into the great stove in the middle of the room  he went 
about his business  and left me in a brown study  

i now took the measure of the bench  and found that 
it was a foot too short   but that could be mended with 
a chair  but it was a foot too narrow  and the other 
bench in the room was about four inches higher than the 
planed one so there was no yoking them  i then placed 
the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space 
against the wall  leaving a little interval between  for my 
back to settle down in  but i soon found that there 
came such a draught of cold air over me from under the 
sill of the window  that this plan would never do at all  
especially as another current from the rickety door met 
the one from the window  and both together formed a 
series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the 
spot where i had thought to spend the night  

the devil fetch that harpooneer  thought i  but stop  
couldn t i steal a march on him bolt his door inside  and 
jump into his bed  not to be wakened by the most violent 
knockings   it seemed no bad idea   but upon second 
thoughts i dismissed it  for who could tell but what 
the next morning  so soon as i popped out of the room  
the harpooneer might be standing in the entry  all ready 
to knock me down   

still  looking round me again  and seeing no possible 
chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other 
person s bed  i began to think that after all i might be 
cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown 



the spoqter-inn 21 

harpooneer  thinks i  i  11 wait awhile   he must be 
dropping in before long  1 11 have a good look at him 
then  and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows 
after all there  s no telling  

but though the other boarders kept coming in by 
ones  twos  and threes  and going to bed  yet no sign of 
my harpooneer  

4 landlord     said i    what sort of a chap is he does 
he always keep such late hours     it was now hard 
upon twelve o clock  

the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle  
and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond 
my comprehension    no   he answered    generally he 5 s 
an early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes  he  s 
the bird what catches the worm  but to-night he 
went out a-peddling  you see  and i don t see what 
on airth keeps him so late  unless  maybe  he can t sell 
his head   

  can t sell his head   what sort of a bamboozingly 
story is this you are telling me     getting into a tower- 
ing rage    do you pretend to say  landlord  that this 
harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday 
night  or rather sunday morning  in peddling his head 
around this town     

  that  s precisely it   said the landlord    and i told 
him he couldn t sell it here  the market  s overstocked   

  with what     shouted i  

  with heads  to be sure   ain t there too many heads 
in the world     

  i tell you what it is  landlord   said i  quite calmly  
  you  d better stop spinning that yarn to me i  m not 
green   

6 maybe not    taking out a stick and whittling a tooth- 
pick    but i rayther guess you  11 be done brown if that 
 ere harpooneer hears you a-slanderin  his head   



22 moby-dick 

  i  11 break it for him  said i  now flying into a passion 
again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord s  

  it  s broke a  ready   said he  

  broke  said i   broke  do you mean     

  sartain  and that  s the very reason he can t sell it  
i guess   

  landlord  said i  going up to him as cool as mt  
hecla in a snow-storm   landlord  stop whittling  you 
and i must understand one another  and that too without 
delay  i come to your house and want a bed   you tell 
me you can only give me half a one   that the other half 
belongs to a certain harpooneer  and about this har- 
pooneer  whom i have not yet seen  you persist in telling 
me the most mystifying and exasperating stories  tending 
to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling toward the man 
whom you design for my bedfellow  a sort of connection  
landlord  which is an intimate and confidential one in the 
highest degree  i now demand of you to speak out and 
tell me who and what this harpooneer is  and whether i 
shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him  
and in the first place  you will be so good as to unsay that 
story about selling his head  which if true i take to be 
good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad  and i  ve 
no idea of sleeping with a madman   and you  sir  you 
i mean  landlord  you  sir  by trying to induce me to do 
so knowingly  would thereby render yourself liable to a 
criminal prosecution   

  wall  said the landlord  fetching a long breath   that  s 
a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and 
then  but be easy  be easy  this here harpooneer i have 
been tellin  you of has just arrived from the south seas  
where he bought up a lot of  balmed new zealand heads 
 great curios  you know   and he  s sold all on  em but 
one  and that one he  s tryin  to sell to-night  cause to- 
morrow  s sunday  and it would not do to be sellin  



the spouter-inn 23 

human heads about the streets when folks is goin  to 
churches  he wanted to  last sunday  but i stopped him 
just as he was goin  out of the door with four heads strung 
on a string  for all the airth like a string of inions   

this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable 
mystery  and showed that the landlord  after all  had had 
no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could 
i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday 
night clean into the holy sabbath  engaged in such a 
cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolaters   

  depend upon it  landlord  that harpooneer is a danger- 
ous man   

  he pays reg lar  5 was the rejoinder    but come  
it  s getting dreadful late  you had better be turning 
flukes it  s a nice bed   sail and me slept in that  ere 
bed the night we were spliced  there  s plenty room for 
two to kick about in that bed   it  s an almighty big bed 
that  why  afore we give it up  sal used to put our sam 
and little johnny in the foot of it  but i got a-dreaming 
and sprawling about one night  and somehow  sam got 
pitched on the floor  and came near breaking his arm  
arter that  sal said it wouldn t do  come along here  
i  11 give ye a glim in a jiffy     and so saying he lighted a 
candle and held it toward me  offering to lead the way  
but i stood irresolute   when looking at a clock in the 
corner  he exclaimed    i vum it  s sunday you won t 
see that harpooneer to-night   he  s come to anchor some- 
where come along then   do come   won t ye come     

i considered the matter a moment  and then upstairs 
we went  and i was ushered into a small room  cold as a 
clam  and furnished  sure enough  with a prodigious bed  
almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to 
sleep abreast  

  there   said the landlord  placing the candle on a 
crazy old sea-chest that did double duty as a wash-stand 



24 moby-dick 

and centre table     there  make yourself comfortable 
now  and good night to ye   i turned round from eyeing 
the bed  but he had disappeared  

folding back the counterpane  i stooped over the bed  
though none of the most elegant  it yet stood the scrutiny 
tolerably well  i then glanced round the room   and 
besides the bedstead and centre table  could see no other 
furniture belonging to the place  but a rude shelf  the four 
walls  and a papered fire-board representing a man striking 
a whale  of things not properly belonging to the room  
there was a hammock lashed up  and thrown upon the 
floor in one corner   also a large seaman s bag  containing 
the harpooneer s wardrobe  no doubt in lieu of a land trunk  
likewise  there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish-hooks 
on the shelf over the fire-place  and a tall harpoon stand- 
ing at the head of the bed  

but what is this on the chest   i took it up  and held 
it close to the light  and felt it  and smelt it  and tried 
every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory con- 
clusion concerning it  i can compare it to nothing but 
a large door-mat  ornamented at the edges with little 
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills 
round an indian moccasin  there was a hole or slit in 
the middle of this mat  as you see the same in south 
american ponchos  but could it be possible that any 
sober harpooneer would get into a door-mat  and parade 
the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise   
i put it on  to try it  and it weighed me down like a hamper  
being uncommonly shaggy and thick  and i thought a 
little damp  as though this mysterious harpooneer had 
been wearing it of a rainy day  i went up in it to a bit 
of glass stuck against the wall  and i never saw such a 
sight in my life  i tore myself out of it in such a hurry 
that i gave myself a kink in the neck  

i sat down on the side of the bed  and commenced 



the spouter-inn 25 

thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer  and his 
door-mat  after thinking some time on the bedside  i 
got up and took off my monkey-jacket  and then stood 
in the middle of the room thinking  i then took off my 
coat  and thought a little more in my shirt -sleeves  but 
beginning to feel very cold now  half undressed as i was  
and remembering what the landlord said about the har- 
pooneer  s not coming home at all that night  it being so 
very late  i made no more ado  but jumped out of my 
pantaloons and boots  and then blowing out the light 
tumbled into bed  and commended myself to the care of 
heaven  

whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or 
broken crockery  there is no telling  but i rolled about a 
good deal  and could not sleep for a long time  at last 
i slid off into a light doze  and had pretty nearly made a 
good offing toward the land of nod  when i heard a 
heavy footfall in the passage  and saw a glimmer of light 
come into the room from under the door  

lord save me  thinks i  that must be the harpooneer  
the infemal head-peddler  but i lay perfectly still  and 
resolved not to say a word till spoken to  holding a 
light in one hand  and that identical new zealand head 
in the other  the stranger entered the room  and without 
looking toward the bed  placed his candle a good way 
off from me on the floor in one corner  and then began 
working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i 
before spoke of as being in the room  i was all eagerness 
to see his face  but he kept it averted for some time while 
employed in unlacing the bag  s mouth   this accomplished  
however  he turned round when  good heavens   what a 
sight   such a face   it was of a dark  purplish  yellow 
colour  here and there stuck over with large  blackish- 
looking squares  yes  it  s just as i thought  he  s a 
terrible bedfellow   he  s been in a fight  got dreadfully 



26 moby-dick 

cut  and here he is  just from the surgeon  but at that 
moment he chanced to turn his face so toward the light  
that i plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at 
all  those black squares on his cheeks  they were stains 
of some sort or other  at first i knew not what to make 
of this   but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me  
i remembered a story of a white man a whaleman too 
who  falling among the cannibals  had been tattooed by 
them  i concluded that this harpooneer  in the course of 
his distant voyages  must have met with a similar adven- 
ture  and what is it  thought i  after all   it  s only 
his outside   a man can be honest in any sort of skin  
but then  what to make of his unearthly complexion  
that part of it  i mean  lying round about  and completely 
independent of the squares of tattooing  to be sure  it 
might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning   
but i never heard of a hot sun s tanning a white man into 
a purplish-yellow one  however  i had never been in 
the south seas   and perhaps the sun there produced 
these extraordinary effects upon the skin  now  while 
all these ideas were passing through me like lightning  
this harpooneer never noticed me at all  but  after some 
difficulty having opened his bag  he commenced fumbling 
in it  and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk  and 
a sealskin wallet with the hair on  placing these on the 
old chest in the middle of the room  he then took the new 
zealand head a ghastly thing enough and crammed it 
down into the bag  he now took off his hat a new 
beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh 
surprise  there was no hair on his head none to speak 
of  at least nothing but a small scalp -knot twisted up on 
his forehead  his bald purplish head now looked for 
all the world like a mildewed skull  had not the stranger 
stood between me and the door  i would have bolted out 
of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner  



the spouter-inn 27 

even as it was  i thought something of slipping out 
of the window  but it was the second floor back  i am 
no coward  but what to make of this head-peddling purple 
rascal altogether passed my comprehension  ignorance  
js the parent qjjear  and being completely nonplussed 
and confounded about the stranger  i confess i was now 
as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who 
had thus broken into my room at the dead of night  in 
fact  i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough 
just then to address him  and demand a satisfactory 
answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him  

meanwhile  he continued the business of undressing  
and at last showed his chest and arms  as i live  these 
covered parts of him were checkered with the same 
squares as his face   his back  too  was all over the same 
dark squares   he seemed to have been in a thirty years  
war  and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt  
still more  his very legs were marked  as if a parcel of 
dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young 
palms  it was now quite plain that he must be some 
abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whale- 
man in the south seas  and so landed in this christian 
country  i quaked to think of it  a peddler of heads too 
perhaps the heads of his own brothers  he might take 
a fancy to mine heavens   look at that tomahawk   

but there was no time for shuddering  for now the 
savage went about something that completely fascinated 
my attention  and convinced me that he must indeed be 
a heathen  going to his heavy grego  or wrapall  or 
dreadnaught  which he had previously hung on a chair  
he fumbled in the pockets  and produced at length a 
curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back  
and exactly the colour of a three-days-old congo baby  
remembering the embalmed head  at first i almost 
thought that this black manikin was a real baby pre- 



28 moby-dick 

served in some similar manner  but seeing that it was 
not at all limber  and that it glistened a good deal like 
polished ebony  i concluded that it must be nothing but 
a wooden idol  which indeed it proved to be  for now 
the savage goes up to the empty fire-place  and removing 
the papered fire -board  sets up this little hunchbacked 
image  like a ten-pin  between the andirons  the chimney 
jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty  so that 
i thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little 
shrine or chapel for his congo idol  

i now screwed my eyes hard toward the half-hidden 
image  feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was 
next to follow  first he takes about a double handful 
of shavings out of his grego pocket  and places them 
carefully before the idol   then laying a bit of ship -biscuit 
on top and applying the flame from the lamp  he kindled 
 the shavings into a sacrificial blaze  presently  after 
many hasty snatches into the fire  and still hastier with- 
drawals of his fingers  whereby he seemed to be scorching 
them badly   he at last succeeded in drawing out the 
biscuit   then blowing off the heat and ashes a little  
he made a polite offer of it to the little negro  but the 
little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at 
all   he never moved his lips  all these strange antics 
were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from 
the devotee  who seemed to be praying in a sing-song 
or else singing some pagan psalmody or other  during 
which his face twitched about in the most unnatural 
manner  at last  extinguishing the fire  he took the idol 
up very unceremoniously  and bagged it again in his 
grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman 
bagging a dead woodcock  

all these queer proceedings increased my uncomf ortable- 
ness  and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of 
concluding his business operations  and jumping into bed 



the spouter-inn 29 

with me  i thought it was high time  now or never  before 
the light was put out  to break the spell in which i had 
so long been bound  

but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say 
was a fatal one  taking up his tomahawk from the table  
he examined the head of it for an instant  and then hold- 
ing it to the light  with his mouth at the handle  he puffed 
out great clouds of tobacco smoke  the next moment 
the light was extinguished  and this wild cannibal  toma- 
hawk between his teeth  sprang into bed with me  i 
sang out  i could not help it now   and giving a sudden 
grunt of astonishment he began feeling me  

stammering out something  i knew not what  i rolled 
away from him against the wall  and then conjured him  
whoever or whatever he might be  to keep quiet  and let 
me get up and light the lamp again  but his guttural 
responses satisfied me at once that he but ill compre- 
hended my meaning  

  who-e debel you     he at last said   you no speak-e  
dam-me  i kill-e   and so saying the lighted tomahawk 
began flourishing about me in the dark  

4 landlord  for god s sake  peter coffin     shouted i  
  landlord   watch   coffin   angels   save me     

1 speak-e   tell-ee me who-ee be  or dam-me  i kill-e     
again growled the cannibal  while his horrid flourishings 
of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about 
me till i thought my linen would get on fire  but thank 
heaven  at that moment the landlord came into the room 
light in hand  and leaping from the bed i ran up to him  

4 don t be afraid now   said he  grinning again    quee- 
queg here wouldn t harm a hair of your head   

  stop your grinning   shouted i    and why didn t you 
tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal     

  i thought ye know d it   didn t i tell ye  he was 
a-peddlin  heads around town   but turn flukes again 



30 moby-dick 

and go to sleep  queequeg  look here you sabbee me  
i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee     

  me sabbee plenty   grunted queequeg  puffing away 
at his pipe and sitting up in bed  

  you gettee in  he added  motioning to me with his 
tomahawk  and throwing the clothes to one side  he 
really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and 
charitable way  i stood looking at him a moment  for 
all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean  comely- 
looking cannibal  what  s all this fuss i have been 
making about  thought i to myself the man   s a human 
being just as i am   he has just as much reason to fear 
me  as i have to be afraid of him  better sleep with a 
sober cannibal than a drunken christian  

 landlord   said i   tell him to stash his tomahawk 
there  or pipe  or whatever you call it   tell him to stop 
smoking  in short  and i will turn in with him  but i 
don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me  it  s 
dangerous  besides  i ain t insured   

this being told to queequeg  he at once complied  and 
again politely motioned me to get into bed rolling over 
to one side as much as to say  i won t touch a leg of ye  

  good night  landlord   said i    you may go   

i turned in  and never slept better in my life  






chapter iv 

the counterpane 

upon waking next morning about daylight  i found 
queequeg s arm thrown over me in the most loving and 
affectionate manner  you had almost thought i had 
been his wife  the counterpane was of patchwork  full 
of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles   and 
this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable 
cretan labyrinth of a figure  no two parts of which were 
of one precise shade owing  i suppose  to his keeping 
his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade  his 
shirt-sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times 
this same arm of his  i say  looked for all the world like 
a strip of that same patchwork quilt  indeed  partly 
lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke  i could 
hardly tell it from the quilt  they so blended their hues 
together   and it was only by the sense of weight and 
pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me  
my sensations were strange  let me try to explain 
them  when i was a child  i well remember a somewhat 
similar circumstance that befell me   whether it was a 
reality or a dream  i never could entirely settle  the 
circumstance was this  i had been cutting up some 
caper or other i think it was trying to crawl up the 
chimney  as i had seen a little sweep do a few days 
previous   and my stepmother  who  somehow or other  
was all the time whipping me  or sending me to bed 
supperless  my mother dragged me by the legs out 
of the chimney and packed me off to bed  though it was 
only two o clock in the afternoon of the 21st june  the

longest day in the year in our hemisphere  1 felt dread- 
fully  but there was no help for it  so upstairs i went 
to my little room in the third floor  undressed myself as 
slowly as possible so as to kill time  and with a bitter 
sigh got between the sheets  

i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire 
hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection  
sixteen hours in bed   the small of my back ached to 
think of it  and it was so light too   the sun shining 
in at the window  and a great rattling of coaches in the 
streets  and the sound of gay voices all over the house  
i felt worse and worse at last i got up  dressed  and 
softly going down in my stockinged feet  sought out my 
stepmother  and suddenly threw myself at her feet  be- 
seeching her as a particular favour to give me a good 
slippering for my misbehaviour   anything indeed but con- 
demning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of 
time  but she was the best and most conscientious of 
stepmothers  and back i had to go to my room  for 
several hours i lay there broad awake  feeling a great 
deal worse than i have ever done since  even from the 
greatest subsequent misfortunes  at last i must have 
fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze   and slowly 
waking from it half steeped in dreams i opened my 
eyes  and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in 
outer darkness  instantly i felt a shock running through 
all my frame   nothing was to be seen  and nothing was 
to be heard   but a supernatural hand seemed placed 
in mine  my arm hung over the counterpane  and the 
nameless  unimaginable  silent form or phantom  to which 
the hand belonged  seemed closely seated by my bedside  
for what seemed ages piled on ages  i lay there  frozen 
with the most awful fears  not daring to drag away my 
hand   yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one 
single inch  the horrid spell would be broken  i knew 



the counterpane 33 

not how this consciousness at last glided away from me   
but waking in the morning  i shudderingly remembered 
it all  and for days and weeks and months afterward i 
lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery  
nay  to this very hour  i often puzzle myself with it  

now  take away the awful fear  and my sensations at 
feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar  
in their strangeness  to those which i experienced on 
waking up and seeing queequeg  s pagan arm thrown 
round me  but at length all the past night s events 
soberly recurred  one by one  in fixed reality  and then i 
lay only alive to the comical predicament  for though 
i tried to move his arm unlock his bridegroom clasp 
yet  sleeping as he was  he still hugged me tightly  as 
though naught but death should part us twain  i now 
strove to rouse him   queequeg     but his only answer 
was a snore  i then rolled over  my neck feeling as if 
it were in a horse-collar   and suddenly felt a slight 
scratch  throwing aside the counterpane  there lay the 
tomahawk sleeping by the savage s side  as if it were a 
hatchet -faced baby  a pretty pickle  truly  thought i   
abed here in a strange house in the broad day  with a 
cannibal and a tomahawk     queequeg   in the name 
of goodness  queequeg  wake     at length  by dint of 
much wriggling  and loud and incessant expostulations 
upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow-male in 
that matrimonial sort of style  i succeeded in extracting 
a grunt   and presently  he drew back his arm  shook 
himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the 
water  and sat up in bed  stiff as a pikestaff  looking at 
me  and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether re- 
member how i came to be there  though a dim conscious- 
ness of knowing something about me seemed slowly 
dawning over him  meanwhile  i lay quietly eyeing him  
having no serious misgivings now  and bent upon narrowly

observing so curious a creature  when  at last  his mind 
seemed made up touching the character of his bed- 
fellow  and he became  as it were  reconciled to the fact  
he jumped out upon the floor  and by certain signs and 
sounds gave me to understand that  if it pleased me  he 
would dress first and then leave me to dress afterward  
leaving the whole apartment to myself  thinks i  
queequeg  under the circumstances  this is a very civilised 
overture   but  the truth is  these savages have an innate 
sense of delicacy  say what you will   it is marvellous how 
essentially polite they are  i pay this particular compli- 
ment to queequeg  because he treated me with so much 
civility and consideration  while i was guilty of great 
rudeness   staring at him from the bed  and watching all 
his toilet motions   for the time my curiosity getting the 
better of my breeding  nevertheless  a man like quee- 
queg you don t see every day  he and his ways were well 
worth unusual regarding  

he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver 
hat  a very tall one  by the by  and then still minus his 
trowsers he hunted up his boots  what under the 
heavens he did it for  i cannot tell  but his next movement 
was to crush himself boots in hand  and hat on under 
the bed   when  from sundry violent gaspings and strain- 
ings  i inferred he was hard at work booting himself   
though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is 
any man required to be private when putting on his boots  
but queequeg  do you see  was a creature in the transi- 
tion state neither caterpillar nor butterfly  he was 
just enough civilised to show off his outlandishness in the 
strangest possible manner  his education was not yet 
completed  he was an undergraduate  if he had not 
been a small degree civilised  he very probably would 
not have troubled himself with boots at all   but then  
if he had not been still a savage  he never would have

dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on  at 
last  he emerged with his hat very much dented and 
crushed down over his eyes  and began creaking and 
limping about the room  as if  not being much accustomed 
to boots  his pair of damp  wrinkled cowhide ones pro- 
bably not made to order either rather pinched and 
tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning  

seeing  now  that there were no curtains to the window  
and that the street being very narrow  the house opposite 
commanded a plain view into the room  and observing 
more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg 
made  staving about with little else but his hat and boots 
on  i begged him as well as i could  to accelerate his 
toilet somewhat  and particularly to get into his panta- 
loons as soon as possible  he complied  and then pro- 
ceeded to wash himself  at that time in the morning 
any christian would have washed his face   but queequeg  
to my amazement  contented himself with restricting 
his ablutions to his chest  arms  and hands  he then 
donned his waistcoat  and taking up a piece of hard soap 
on the wash-stand centre table  dipped it into water and 
commenced lathering his face  i was watching to see 
where he kept his razor  when lo and behold  he takes the 
harpoon from the bed corner  slips out the long wooden 
stock  unsheathes the head  whets it a little on his boot  
and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall  
begins a vigorous scraping  or rather harpooning of his 
cheeks  thinks i  queequeg  this is using rogers s best 
cutlery with a vengeance  afterward i wondered the 
less at this operation when i came to know of what 
fine steel the head of a harpoon is made  and how 
exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept  

the rest of his toilet was soon achieved  and he proudly 
marched out of the room  wrapped up in his great pilot 
monkey-jacket  and sporting his harpoon like a marshal s 
baton

breakfast 

i quickly followed suit  and descending into the bar-room 
accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly  i 
cherished no malice toward him  though he had been 
skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my 
bedfellow  

however  a good laugh is a mighty good thing  and 
rather too scarce a good thing   the more  s the pity  so  
if any one man  in his own proper person  afford stuff for 
a good joke to anybody  let him not be backward  but let 
him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in 
that way  and the man that has anything bountifully 
laughable about him  be sure there is more in that man 
than you perhaps think for  

the bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been 
dropping in the night previous  and whom i had not as 
yet had a good look at  they were nearly all whalemen   
chief mates  and second mates  and third mates  and sea- 
carpenters  and sea-coopers  and sea-blacksmiths  and 
harpooneers  and ship-keepers   a brown and brawny 
company  with bosky beards   an unshorn  shaggy set  
all wearing monkey-jackets for morning gowns  

you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had 
been ashore  this young fellow s healthy cheek is like 
a sun-toasted pear in hue  and would seem to smell 
almost as musky   he cannot have been three days landed 
from his indian voyage  that man next him looks a 
few shades lighter   you might say a touch of satinwood

breakfast 37 

is in him  in the complexion of a third still lingers a 
tropic tawn  but slightly bleached withal   lie doubtless 
has tarried whole weeks ashore  but who could show a 
cheek like queequeg   which  barred with various tints  
seemed like the andes  western slope  to show forth in 
one array  contrasting climates  zone by zone  

  grub  ho     now cried the landlord  flinging open a 
door  and in we went to breakfast  

they say that men who have seen the world  thereby 
become quite at ease in manner  quite self-possessed in 
company  not always  though   ledyard  the great new 
england traveller  and mungo park  the scotch one   of 
all men  they possessed the least assurance in the parlour  
but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge 
drawn by dogs as ledyard did  or the taking a long solitary 
walk on an empty stomach  in the negro heart of africa  
which was the sum of poor mungo  s performances this 
kind of travel  i say  may not be the very best mode of 
attaining a high social polish  still  for the most part  
that sort of thing is to be had anywhere  

these reflections just here are occasioned by the cir- 
cumstance that after we were all seated at the table  and 
i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling   
to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a 
profound silence  and not only that  but they looked 
embarrassed  yes  here were a set of sea-dogs  many of 
whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded 
great whales on the high seas entire strangers to them 
and duelled them dead without winking   and yet  here 
they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling  
all of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at 
each other as though they had never been out of sight 
of some sheepfold among the green mountains  a 
curious sight   these bashful bears  these timid warrior 
whalemen

but as for queequeg why  queequeg sat there among 
them at the head of the table  too  it so chanced as 
cool as an icicle  to be sure  i cannot say much for his 
breeding  his greatest admirer could not have cordially 
justified his bringing his harpoon in to breakfast with him  
and using it there without ceremony   reaching over the 
table with it  to the imminent jeopardy of many heads  
and grappling the beefsteaks toward him  but that 
was certainly very coolly done by him  and everyone 
knows that in most people s estimation  to do anything 
coolly is to do it genteelly  

we will not speak of all queequeg s peculiarities here   
how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls  and applied his 
undivided attention to beefsteaks  done rare  enough  
that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest 
into the public room  lighted his tomahawk-pipe  and was 
sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his 
inseparable hat on  when i sallied out for a stroll  



chapter vi 

the street 

if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so 
outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among 
the polite society of a civilised town  that astonishment 
soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through 
the streets of new bedford  

in thoroughfares nigh the docks  any considerable sea- 
port will frequently offer to view the queerest -looking 
nondescripts from foreign parts  even in broadway 
and chestnut streets  mediterranean mariners will some- 
times jostle the affrighted ladies  regent street is not 
unknown to lascars and malays   and at bombay  in the 
apollo green  live yankees have often scared the natives  
but new bedford beats all water street and wapping  
in these last -mentioned haunts you see only sailors   but 
in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street 
corners   savages outright   many of whom yet carry on 
their bones unholy flesh  it makes a stranger stare  

but  besides the feegeeans  tongatabooarrs  erro- 
manggoans  pannangians  and brighggians  and besides 
the wild specimens of the whaling -craft which unheeded 
reel about the streets  you will see other sights still more 
curious  certainly more comical  there weekly arrive 
in this town scores of green vermonters and new hamp- 
shire men  all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery  
they are mostly young  of stalwart frames   fellows who 
have felled forests  and now seek to drop the axe and 
snatch the whale-lance  many are as green as the green 



40 moby-dick 

mountains whence they came  in some things you would 
think them but a few hours old  look there   that chap 
strutting round the corner  he wears a beaver hat and 
swallow-tailed coat  girdled with a sailor -belt and a sheath- 
knife  here comes another with a sou  -wester and a 
bombazine cloak  

no town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred 
one i mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that  
in the dog-days  will mow his two acres in buckskin 
gloves for fear of tanning his hands  now when a country 
dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distin- 
guished reputation  and joins the great whale-fishery  you 
should see the comical things he does upon reaching the 
seaport  in bespeaking his sea -out fit  he orders bell- 
buttons to his waistcoats   straps to his canvas trowsers  
ah  poor hay-seed   how bitterly will burst those straps 
in the first howling gale  when thou art driven  straps  
buttons  and all  down the throat of the tempest  

but think not that this famous town has only har- 
pooneers  cannibals  and bumpkins to show her visitors  
not at all  still new bedford is a queer place  had it 
not been for us whalemen  that tract of land would this 
day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the 
coast of labrador  as it is  parts of her back country 
are enough to frighten one  they look so bony  the town 
itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in  hi all new 
england  it is a land of oil  true enough   but not like 
caanan   a land  also  of corn and wine  the streets do 
not run with milk   nor in the spring-time do they pave 
them with fresh eggs  yet  in spite of this  nowhere in 
all america will you find more patrician-like houses   
parks and gardens more opulent  than hi new bedford  
whence came they   how planted upon this once scraggy 
scoria of a country   

go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons 






the street 41 

round yonder lofty mansion  and your question will be 
answered  yes   all these brave houses and flowery 
gardens came from the atlantic  pacific  and indian oceans  
one and all  they were harpooned and dragged up hither 
from the bottom of the sea  can herr alexander per- 
form a feat like that   

in new bedford  fathers  they say  give whales for 
dowers to their daughters  and portion off their nieces 
with a few porpoises apiece  you must go to new bed- 
ford to see a brilliant wedding   for  they say  they have 
reservoirs of oil in every house  and every night recklessly 
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles  

in summer time  the town is sweet to see   full of fine 
maples long avenues of green and gold  and in august  
high in air  the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts  
candelabra-wise  proffer the passer-by their tapering 
upright cones of congregated blossoms  so omnipotent   
is art   which in many a district of new bedford has 
superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren 
refuse rocks thrown aside at creation s final day  

and the women of new bedford  they bloom like their 
own red roses  but roses only bloom in summer   whereas 
the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight 
in the seventh heavens  elsewhere match that bloom 
of theirs  ye cannot  save in salem  where they tell me 
the young girls breathe such musk  their sailor sweet- 
hearts smell them miles off shore  as though they were 
drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic 
sands  



chapter vii 

the chapel 

in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman s 
chapel  and few are the moody fishermen  shortly bound 
for the indian ocean or pacific  who fail to make a sunday 
visit to the spot  i am sure that i did not  

returning from my first morning stroll  i again sallied 
out upon this special errand  the sky had changed from 
clear  sunny cold  to driving sleet and mist  wrapping 
myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin  
i fought my way against the stubborn storm  entering  
i found a small scattered congregation of sailors  and 
sailors  wives and widows  a muffled silence reigned  
only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm  each 
silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from 
the other  as if each silent grief were insular and incom- 
municable  the chaplain had not yet arrived   and there 
these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly 
eyeing several marble tablets  with black borders  masoned 
into the wall on either side the pulpit  three of them 
ran something like the following  but i do not pretend to 
quote

shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket  
i seated myself near the door  and turning sideways was 
surprised to see queequeg near me  affected by the 
solemnity of the scene  there was a wondering gaze of 
incredulous curiosity in his countenance  this savage 
was the only person present who seemed to notice my 
entrance   because he was the only one who could not 
read  and  therefore  was not reading those frigid inscrip- 
tions on the wall  whether any of the relatives of the 



44 moby-dick 

seamen whose names appeared there were now among 
the congregation  i knew not   but so many are the unre- 
corded accidents in the fishery  and so plainly did several 
women present wear the countenance if not the trappings 
of some unceasing grief  that i feel sure that here before 
me were assembled those  in whose unhealing hearts the 
sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the 
old wounds to bleed afresh  

oh   ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass   
who standing among flowers can say here  here lies my 
beloved   ye know not the desolation that broods in 
bosoms like these  what bitter blanks in those black- 
bordered marbles which cover no ashes   what despair 
in those immovable inscriptions   what deadly voids 
and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw 
upon all faith  and refuse resurrections to the beings who 
have placelessly perished without a grave  as well might 
those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here  

li what census of living creatures  the dead of mankind 
are included   why it is that a universal proverb says of 
them  that they tell no tales  though containing more 
secrets than the goodwin sands   how it is that to his 
name who yesterday departed for the other world  we 
prefix so significant and infidel a word  and yet do not 
thus entitle him  if he but embarks for the remotest indies 
of this living earth   why the life insurance companies 
pay death-forfeitures upon immortals   in what eternal  
unstirring paralysis  and deadly  hopeless trance  yet lies 
antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago   how 
it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we 
nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss   
why all the living so strive to hush all the dead   wherefore 
but the rumour of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a 
whole city  all these things are not without their 
meanings  



the chapel 45 

but faith  like a jackal  feeds among the tombs  and 
even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital 
hope  

it needs scarcely to be told  with what feelings  on the 
eve of a nantucket voyage  i regarded those marble 
tablets  and by the murky light of that darkened  doleful 
day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before 
me  yes  ishmael  the same fate may be thine  but 
somehow i grew merry again  delightful inducements to 
embark  fine chance for promotion  it seems ay  a 
stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet  yes  
there is death in this business of whaling a speechlessly 
quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity  but what 
then   methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter 
of life and death  methinks that what they call my 
shadow here on earth is my true substance  methinks 
that in looking at things spiritual  we are too much like 
oysters observing the sun through the water  and thinking 
that thick water the thinnest of air  methinks my body 
is but the lees of my better being  in fact  take my body 
who will  take it i say  it is not me  and therefore three 
cheers for nantucket   and come a stove boat and stove 
body when they will  for stave my soul  jove himself 
cannot  






chapter viii 

the pulpit 

i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain 
venerable robustness entered   immediately as the storm- 
pelted door flew back upon admitting him  a quick regard- 
ful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently 
attested that this fine old man was the chaplain  yes  
it was the famous father mapple  so called by the whale- 
men  among whom he was a very great favourite  he 
had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth  but for 
many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry  
at the time i now write of  father mapple was in the 
hardy winter of a healthy old age   that sort of old age 
which seems merging into a second flowering youth  for 
among all the fissures of his wrinkles  there shone certain 
mild gleams of a newly developing bloom the spring 
verdure peeping forth even beneath february s snow  
no one having previously heard his history  could for 
the first time behold father mapple without the utmost 
interest  because there were certain engrafted clerical 
peculiarities about him  imputable to that adventurous 
maritime life he had led  when he entered i observed 
that he carried no umbrella  and certainly had not come 
in his carriage  for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting 
sleet  and his great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to 
drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had 
absorbed  however  hat and coat and overshoes were 
one by one removed  and hung up in a little space in an 
adjacent corner   when  arrayed in a decent suit  he 
quietly approached the pulpit  

46 



the pulpit 47 

like most old-fashioned pulpits  it was a very lofty one  
and since a regular stairs to such a height would  by its 
long angle with the floor  seriously contract the already 
small area of the chapel  the architect  it seemed  had 
acted upon the hint of father mapple  and finished the 
pulpit without a stairs  substituting a perpendicular side 
ladder  like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at 
sea  the wife of a whaling-captain had provided the chapel 
with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this 
ladder  which  being itself nicely headed  and stained with 
a mahogany colour  the whole contrivance  considering 
what manner of chapel it was  seemed by no means in bad 
taste  halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder  
and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs 
of the man-ropes  father mapple cast a look upward  
and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential 
dexterity  hand over hand  mounted the steps as if 
ascending the main -top of his vessel  

the perpendicular parts of this side ladder  as is usually 
the case with swinging ones  were of cloth-covered rope  
only the rounds were of wood  so that at every step there 
was a joint  at my first glimpse of the pulpit  it had not 
escaped me that however convenient for a ship  these 
joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary  for 
i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining 
the height  slowly turn round  and stooping over the 
pulpit  deliberately drag up the ladder step by step  till 
the whole was deposited within  leaving him impregnable 
in his little quebec  

i pondered some time without fully comprehending 
the reason for this  father mapple enjoyed such a wide 
reputation for sincerity and sanctity  that i could not 
suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of 
the stage  no  thought i  there must be some sober 
reason for this thing   furthermore  it must symbolise 



48 moby-dick 

something unseen  can it be  then  that by that act of 
physical isolation  he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for 
the time  from all outward worldly ties and connections   
yes  for replenished with the meat and wine of the word  
to the faithful man of god  this pulpit  i see  is a self- 
containing stronghold a lofty ehrenbreitstein  with a 
perennial well of water within the walls  

but the side ladder was not the only strange feature 
of the place  borrowed from the chaplain s former sea- 
farings  between the marble cenotaphs on either hand 
of the pulpit  the wall which formed its back was adorned 
with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating 
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and 
snowy breakers  but high above the flying scud and 
dark-rolling clouds  there floated a little isle of sunlight  
from which beamed forth an angel s face   and this bright 
face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship s tossed 
deck  something like that silver plate now inserted into the 
victory s plank where nelson fell    ah  noble ship  the 
angel seemed to say   beat on  beat on  thou noble ship  and 
bear a hardy helm   for lo   the sun is breaking through   
the clouds are rolling off serenest azure is at hand   

nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same 
sea -taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture  
its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship s bluff bows  
and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll 
work  fashioned after a ship s fiddle -headed beak  

what could be more full of meaning   for the pulpit 
is ever this earth s foremost part   all the rest comes in 
its rear   the pulpit leads the world  from thence it is 
the storm of god s quick wrath is first descried  and the 
bow must bear the earliest brunt  from thence it is the 
god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable 
winds  yes  the world  s a ship on its passage out  and 
not a voyage complete   and the pulpit is its prow  



chapter ix 



the sermon 

father mapple rose  and in a mild voice of unassuming 
authority ordered the scattered people to condense  
  starboard gangway  there   side away to larboard 
larboard gangway to starboard   midships   midships     

there was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the 
benches  and a still slighter shuffling of women s shoes  
and all was quiet again  and every eye on the preacher  

he paused a little   then kneeling in the pulpit s bows  
folded his large brown hands across his chest  uplifted 
his closed eyes  and offered a prayer so deeply devout 
that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of 
the sea  

this ended  in prolonged solemn tones  like the continual 
tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog 
in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn   
but changing his manner toward the concluding stanzas  
burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy   

  the ribs and terrors in the whale 

arched over me a dismal gloom  
while all god s sun-lit waves rolled by

nearly all joined in singing this hymn  which swelled 
high above the howling of the storm  a brief pause 
ensued   the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of 
the bible  and at last  folding his hand down upon the 
proper page  said     beloved shipmates  clinch the last 
verse of the first chapter of jonah   and god had pre- 
pared a great fish to swallow up jonah   

  shipmates  this book  containing only four chapters 
four yarns is one of the smallest strands in the mighty 
cable of the scriptures  yet what depths of the soul does 
jonah s deep sea-line sound   what a pregnant lesson to 
us is this prophet   what a noble thing is that canticle 
in the fish s belly   how billow-like and boisterously 
grand   we feel the floods surging over us   we sound with 
him to the kelpy bottom of the waters   sea-weed and all 
the slime of the sea is about us   but what is this lesson 
that the book of jonah teaches   shipmates  it is a two- 
stranded lesson   a lesson to us all as sinful men  and a 
lesson to me as a pilot of the living god  as sinful men  
it is a lesson to us all  because it is a story of the sin  hard- 
heartedness  suddenly awakened fears  the swift punish-   



the sermon 51 

ment  repentance  prayers  and finally the deliverance and 
joy of jonah  as with all sinners among men  the sin 
of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the 
command of god never mind now what that command 
was  or how conveyed which he found a hard command  
but all the things that god would have us do are hard for 
us to do remember that and hence  he oftener com- 
mands us than endeavours to persuade  and if we obey 
god  we must disobey ourselves   and it is in this dis- 
obeying ourselves  wherein the hardness of obeying god 
consists  

  with this sin of disobedience in him  jonah still 
further flouts at god  by seeking to flee from him  he 
thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into 
countries where god does not reign  but only the captains 
of this earth  he skulks about the wharves of joppa  
and seeks a ship that  s bound for tarshish  there lurks  
perhaps  a hitherto unheeded meaning here  by all 
accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the 
modern cadiz  that  s the opinion of learned men  and 
where is cadiz  shipmates   cadiz is in spain   as far by 
water  from joppa  as jonah could possibly have sailed 
in those ancient days  when the atlantic was an almost 
unknown sea  because joppa  the modern jaffa  ship- 
mates  is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean  
the syrian   and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand 
miles to the westward from that  just outside the straits 
of gibraltar  see ye not then  shipmates  that jonah 
sought to flee world- wide from god   miserable man   
oh   most contemptible and worthy of all scorn   with 
slouched hat and guilty eye  skulking from his god   
prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening 
to cross the seas  so disordered  self -condemning is his 
look  that had there been policemen in those days  jonah  
on the mere suspicion of something wrong  had been 



52 moby-dick 

arrested ere he touched a deck  how plainly he  s a 
fugitive   no baggage  not a hat-box  valise  or carpet- 
bag  no friends accompany him to the wharf with their 
adieux  at last  after much dodging search  he finds the 
tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo   and 
as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin  all 
the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the 
goods  to mark the stranger s evil eye  jonah sees this   
but in vain he tries to look ah 1 ease and confidence   in 
vain essays his wretched smile  strong intuitions of the 
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent  in their 
gamesome but still serious way  one whispers to the other 
  jack  he  s robbed a widow     or    joe  do you mark 
him   he  s a bigamist     or    harry  lad  i guess he  s the 
adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah  or belike  one 
of the missing murderers from sodom   another runs 
to read the bill that  s stuck against the spile upon the 
wharf to which the ship is moored  offering five hundred 
gold coins for the apprehension of a  parricide  and con- 
taining a description of his person  he reads  and looks 
from jonah to the bill   while all his sympathetic ship- 
mates now crowd round jonah  prepared to lay their 
hands upon him  frighted jonah trembles  and summon- 
ing all his boldness to his face  only looks so much the 
more a coward  he will not confess himself suspected   
but that itself is strong suspicion  so he makes the best 
of it   and when the sailors find him not to be the man that 
is advertised  they let him pass  and he descends into the 
cabin  

    who  s there     cries the captain at his busy desk  
hurriedly making out his papers for the customs  who  s 
there     oh   how that harmless question mangles 
jonah   for the instant he almost turns to flee again  
but he rallies    i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish   
how soon sail ye  sir     thus far the busy captain had 



the sermon 53 

not looked up to jonah  though the man now stands 
before him   but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice  
than he darts a scrutinising glance    we sail with the 
next coming tide   at last he slowly answered  still 
intently eyeing him    no sooner  sir       soon enough 
for any honest man that goes a passenger   ha   jonah  
that  s another stab  but he swiftly calls away the 
captain from that scent    i  11 sail with ye   he says  
  the passage money  how much is that   i  11 pay 
now   for it is particularly written  shipmates  as if it 
were a thing not to be overlooked in this history    that 
he paid the fare thereof   ere the craft did sail  and 
taken with the context  this is full of meaning  

  now jonah s captain  shipmates  was one whose dis- 
cernment detects crime in any  but whose cupidity exposes 
it only in the penniless  in this world  shipmates  sin 
that pays its way can travel freely  and without a pass- 
port   whereas virtue  if a pauper  is stopped at all 
frontiers  so jonah s captain prepares to test the length 
of jonah s purse  ere he judge him openly  he charges 
him thrice the usual sum   and it  s assented to  then 
the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive   but at the 
same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with 
gold  yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse  prudent 
suspicions still molest the captain  he rings every coin 
to find a counterfeit  not a forger  anyway  he mutters   
and jonah is put down for his passage    point out my 
state-room  sir   says jonah now    i  m travel- weary   
i need sleep    thou look st like it   says the captain  
  there  s thy room   jonah enters  and would lock the 
door  but the lock contains no key  hearing him foolishly 
fumbling there  the captain laughs lowly to himself  and 
mutters something about the doors of convicts  cells being 
never allowed to be locked within  all dressed and dusty 
as he is  jonah throws himself into his berth  and finds 



54 moby-dick 

the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead  
the air is close  and jonah gasps  then  in that con- 
tracted hole  sunk  too  beneath the ship s water-line  
jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling 
hour  when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of 
his bowel s wards  

  screwed at its axis against the side  a swinging lamp 
slightly oscillates in jonah s room   and the ship  heeling 
over toward the wharf with the weight of the last bales 
received  the lamp  flame and all  though in slight motion  
still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to 
the room   though  in truth  infallibly straight itself  it 
but made obvious the false  lying levels among which it 
hung  the lamp alarms and frightens jonah   as lying 
in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place  and 
this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his 
restless glance  but that contradiction in the lamp more 
and more appals him  the floor  the ceiling  and the 
side  are all awry    oh   so my conscience hangs in 
me     he groans    straight upward  so it burns   but the 
chambers of my soul are all in crookedness     

  like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies 
to his bed  still reeling  but with conscience yet pricking 
him  as the plungings of the roman race -horse but so 
much the more strike his steel tags into him   as one who 
in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy 
anguish  praying god for annihilation until the fit be 
passed   and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels  a deep 
stupor steals over him  as over the man who bleeds to 
death  for conscience is the wound  and there  s naught 
to staunch it   so  after sore wrestlings in his berth  
jonah s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning 
down to sleep  

c and now the time of tide has come   the ship casts 
off her cables   and from the deserted wharf the un- 



the sermon 55 

cheered ship for tarshish  all careening  glides to sea  
that ship  my friends  was the first of recorded smugglers   
the contraband was jonah  but the sea rebels   he will 
not bear the wicked burden  a dreadful storm comes on  
the ship is like to break  but now when the boatswain 
calls all hands to lighten her   when boxes  bales  and 
jars are clattering overboard   when the wind is shrieking  
and the men are yelling  and every plank thunders with 
trampling feet right over jonah s head   in all this raging 
tumult  jonah sleeps his hideous sleep  he sees no black 
sky and raging sea  feels not the reeling timbers  and little 
hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale  
which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas 
after him  ay  shipmates  jonah was gone down into 
the sides of the ship a berth in the cabin as i have taken 
it and was fast asleep  but the frightened master comes 
to him  and shrieks hi his dead ear    what meanest thou  
sleeper   arise     startled from his lethargy by that 
direful cry  jonah staggers to his feet  and stumbling to 
the deck  grasps a shroud  to look out upon the sea  but 
at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow 
leaping over the bulwarks  wave after wave thus leaps 
into the ship  and finding no speedy vent runs roaring 
fore and aft  till the mariners come nigh to drowning 
while yet afloat  and ever  as the white moon shows her 
affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness 
overhead  aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing 
high upward  but soon beat downward again toward the 
tormented deep  

  terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul  
in all his cringing attitudes  the god-fugitive is now too 
plainly known  the sailors mark him   more and more 
certain grow their suspicions of him  and at last  fully 
to test the truth  by referring the whole matter to high 
heaven  they fall to casting lots  to see for whose cause 



56 moby-dick 

this great tempest was upon them  the lot is jonah s   
that discovered  then how furiously they mob him with 
their questions    what is thine occupation   whence 
comest thou   thy country   what people     but 
mark now  my shipmates  the behaviour of poor jonah  
the eager mariners but ask him who he is  and where 
from   whereas  they not only receive an answer to those 
questions  but likewise another answer to a question not 
put by them  but the unsolicited answer is forced from 
jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him  

    i am a hebrew   he cries and then   i fear the 
lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the 
dry land     fear him  o jonah   ay  well mightest 
thou fear the lord god then   straightway  he now goes 
on to make a full confession   whereupon the mariners 
became more and more appalled  but still are pitiful  
for when jonah  not yet supplicating god for mercy  
since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts  
when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and 
cast him forth into the sea  for he knew that for his sake 
this great tempest was upon them   they mercifully turn 
from him  and seek by other means to save the ship  
but all in vain   the indignant gale howls louder   then  
with one hand raised invokingly to god  with the other 
they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah  

  and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and 
dropped into the sea   when instantly an oily calmness 
floats out from the east  and the sea is still  as jonah 
carries down the gale with him  leaving smooth water 
behind  he goes down in the whirling heart of such a 
masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment 
when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting 
him   and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth  like so 
many white bolts  upon his prison  then jonah prayed 
unto the lord out of the fish s belly  but observe his 



the sermon 57 

prayer  and learn a weighty lesson  for sinful as he is  
jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance  
he feels that his dreadful punishment is just  he leaves 
all his deliverance to god  contenting himself with this  
that spite of all his pains and pangs  he will still look 
toward his holy temple  and here  shipmates  is true 
and faithful repentance   not clamorous for pardon  but 
grateful for punishment  and how pleasing to god was 
this conduct in jonah  is shown in the eventual deliver- 
ance of him from the sea and the whale  shipmates  i 
do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin  
but i do place him before you as a model for repentance  
sin not   but if you do  take heed to repent of it like jonah    

while he was speaking these words  the howling of the 
shrieking  slanting storm without seemed to add new 
power to the preacher  who  when describing jonah s sea- 
storm  seemed tossed by a storm himself  his deep chest 
heaved as with a ground-swell   his tossed arms seemed 
the warring elements at work   and the thunders that 
rolled away from off his swarthy brow  and the light 
leaping from his eye  made all his simple hearers look on 
him with a quick fear that was strange to them  

there now came a lull in his look  as he silently turned 
over the leaves of the book once more   and  at last  
standing motionless  with closed eyes  for the moment  
seemed communing with god and himself  

but again he leaned over toward the people  and 
bowing his head lowly  with an aspect of the deepest 
yet manliest humility  he spake these words   

c shipmates  god has laid but one hand upon you   
both his hands press upon me  i have read ye by what 
murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches 
to all sinners   and therefore to ye  and still more to me  
for i am a greater sinner than ye  and now how gladly 
would i come down from this mast-head and sit on the 



58 moby-dick 

hatches there where you sit  and listen as you listen  
while some one of you reads me that other and more 
awful lesson which jonah teaches to me  as a pilot of the 
living god  how being an anointed pilot -prophet  or 
speaker of true things  and bidden by the lord to sound 
those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh  
jonah  appalled at the hostility he should raise  fled from 
his mission  and sought to escape his duty and his god by 
taking ship at joppa  but god is everywhere   tarshish 
he never reached  as we have seen  god came upon him 
in the whale  and swallowed him down to living gulfs 
of doom  and with swift slantings tore him along   into 
the midst of the seas   where the eddying depths sucked 
him ten thousand fathoms down  and   the weeds were 
wrapped about his head   and all the watery world of woe 
bowled over him  yet even then beyond the reach of any 
plummet   out of the belly of hell   when the whale 
grounded upon the ocean s utmost bones  even then  god 
heard the engulphed  repenting prophet when he cried  
then god spake unto the fish   and from the shuddering 
cold and blackness of the sea  the whale came breaching 
up toward the warm and pleasant sun  and all the delights 
of air and earth   and   vomited out jonah upon the dry 
land     when the word of the lord came a second time   
and jonah  bruised and beaten his ears  like two sea- 
shells  still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean 
jonah did the almighty s bidding  and what was that  
shipmates   to preach the truth to the face of false- 
hood   that was it   

  this  shipmates  this is that other lesson   and we 
to that pilot of the living god who slights it  woe to 
him whom this world charms from gospel duty   woe 
to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god 
has brewed them into a gale   woe to him who seeks 
to please rather than to appal   woe to him whose good 



the sermon 59 

name is more to him than goodness   woe to him who  
in this world  courts not dishonour   woe to him who 
would not be true  even though to be false were salva- 
tion   yea  woe to him who  as the great pilot paul has 
it  while preaching to others is himself a castaway     

he drooped and fell away from himself for a moment   
then lifting his face to them again  showed a deep joy 
in his eyes  as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm  
  but oh   shipmates   on the starboard hand of every 
woe  there is a sure delight   and higher the top of that 
delight  than the bottom of the woe is deep  is not the 
main-truck higher than the kelson is low   delight is to 
him a far  far upward  and inward delight who against 
the proud gods and commodores of this earth  ever stands 
forth his own inexorable self  delight is to him whose 
strong arms yet support him  when the ship of this base 
treacherous world has gone down beneath him  delight 
is to him  who gives no quarter in the truth  and kills  
burns  and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from 
under the robes of senators and judges  delight  top- 
gallant delight is to him  who acknowledges no law or 
lord  but the lord his god  and is only a patriot to heaven  
delight is to him  whom all the waves of the billows of 
the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this 
sure keel of the ages  and eternal delight and delicious- 
ness will be his  who coming to lay him down  can say with 
his final breath father   chiefly known to me by 
thy rod mortal or immortal  here i die  i have striven 
to be thine  more than to be this world s  or mine own  
yet this is nothing   i leave eternity to thee   for what 
is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god 1   

he said no more  but slowly waving a benediction  
covered his face with his hands  and so remained kneeling  
till all the people had departed  and he was left alone in 
the place  



chapter x 

a bosom friend 

returning to the spouter-inn from the chapel  i found 
queequeg there quite alone   he having left the chapel 
before the benediction some time  he was sitting on a 
bench before the fire  with his feet on the stove hearth  
and in one hand was holding close up to his face that 
little negro idol of his   peering hard into its face  and 
with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose  
meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way  

but being now interrupted  he put up the image   and 
pretty soon  going to the table  took up a large book there  
and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with 
deliberate regularity   at every fiftieth page as i fancied 
stopping a moment  looking vacantly around him  
and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle 
of astonishment  he would then begin again at the next 
fifty   seeming to commence at number one each time  
as though he could not count more than fifty  and it 
was only by such a large number of fifties being found 
together  that his astonishment at the multitude of pages 
was excited  

with much interest i sat watching him  savage 
though he was  and hideously marred about the face 
at least to my taste his countenance yet had a something 
in it which was by no means disagreeable  you cannot 
hide the soul  through all his unearthly tattooings  i 
thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart   and 
in his large  deep eyes  fiery black and bold  there seemed 

60 



a bosom friend 61 

tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils  
and besides all this  there was a certain lofty bearing 
about the pagan  which even his uncouthness could not 
altogether maim  he looked like a man who had never 
cringed and never had had a creditor  whether it was  
too  that his head being shaved  his forehead was drawn 
out in freer and brighter relief  and looked more expansive 
than it otherwise would  this i will not venture to decide   
but certain it was his head was phrenologically an ex- 
cellent one  it may seem ridiculous  but it reminded me 
of general washington s head  as seen in the popular 
busts of him  it had the same long regularly graded 
retreating slope from above the brows  which were like- 
wise very projecting  like two long promontories thickly 
wooded on top  queequeg was george washington 
cannibalistically developed  

whilst i was thus closely scanning him  half pretending 
meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the case- 
ment  he never heeded my presence  never troubled him- 
self with so much as a single glance   but appeared wholly 
occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book  
considering how sociably we had been sleeping together 
the night previous  and especially considering the affection- 
ate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the 
morning  i thought this indifference of his very strange  
but savages are strange beings   at times you do not 
know exactly how to take them  at first they are over- 
awing   their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems 
a socratic wisdom  i had noticed also that queequeg 
never consorted at all  or but very little  with the other 
seamen in the inn  he made no advances whatever   
appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his 
acquaintances  all this struck me as mighty singular   
yet  upon second thoughts  there was something almost 
sublime in it  here was a man some twenty thousand 



i 



62 moby-dick 

miles from home  by the way of cape horn  that is 
which was the only way he could get there thrown 
among people as strange to him as though he were in the 
planet jupiter   and yet he seemed entirely at his ease   
preserving the utmost serenity   content with his own 
companionship   always equal to himself  surely this 
was a touch of fine philosophy   though no doubt he had 
never heard there was such a thing as that  but  per- 
haps  to be true philosophers  we mortals should not 
be conscious of so living or so striving  so soon as i 
hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a 
philosopher  i conclude that  like the dyspeptic old woman  
he must have   broken his digester   

as i sat there in that now lonely room   the fire burn- 
ing low  in that mild stage when  after its first intensity 
has warmed the air  it then only glows to be looked at   
the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the 
casements  and peering in upon us silent  solitary twain   
the storm booming without in solemn swells   i began to 
be sensible of strange feelings  i felt a melting in me  
no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were 
turned against the wolfish world  this soothing savage 
had redeemed it  there he sat  his very indifference 
speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilised 
hypocrisies and bland deceits  wild he was   a very 
sight of sights to see   yet i began to feel myself mysteri- 
ously drawn toward him  and those same things that 
would have repelled most others  they were the very 
magnets that thus drew me  1 11 try a pagan friend  
thought i  since christian kindness has proved but hollow 
courtesy  i drew my bench near him  and made some 
friendly signs and hints  doing my best to talk with him 
meanwhile  at first he little noticed these advances   
but presently  upon my referring to his last night s 
hospitalities  he made out to ask me whether we were 



a bosom friend 



63 



again to be bedfellows  i told him yes   whereat i 
thought he looked pleased  perhaps a little complimented  

we then turned over the book together  and i en- 
deavoured to explain to him the purpose of the printing  
and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it  thus 
i soon engaged his interest   and from that we went to 
jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights 
to be seen in this famous town  soon i proposed a social 
smoke   and  producing his pouch and tomahawk  he 
quietly offered me a puff  and then we sat exchanging 
puffs from that wild pipe of his  and keeping it regularly 
passing between us  

if there yet lurked any ice of indifference toward me 
in the pagan s breast  this pleasant  genial smoke we had 
soon thawed it out  and left us cronies  he seemed to 
take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him   
and when our smoke was over  he pressed his forehead 
against mine  clasped me round the waist  and said that 
henceforth we were married   meaning  in his country s 
phrase  that we were bosom friends   he would gladly 
die for me  if need should be  in a countryman this 
sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too 
premature  a thing to be much distrusted   but in this 
simple savage those old rules would not apply  

after supper  and another social chat and smoke  we 
went to our room together  he made me a present of 
his embalmed head   took out his enormous tobacco 
wallet  and groping under the tobacco  drew out some 
thirty dollars in silver   then spreading them on the 
table  and mechanically dividing them into two equal 
portions  pushed one of them toward me  and said it was 
mine  i was going to remonstrate   but he silenced me 
by pouring them into my trowsers  pockets  i let them 
stay  he then went about his evening prayers  took 
out his idol  and removed the paper fire-board  by 



64 moby-dick 

certain signs and symptoms  i thought he seemed anxious 
for me to join him   but well knowing what was to follow  
i deliberated a moment whether  in case he invited me  
i would comply or otherwise  

i was a good christian   born and bred in the bosom 
of the infallible presbyterian church  how then could 
i unite with this wild idolater in worshipping his piece of 
wood   but what is worship   thought i  do you 
suppose now  ishmael  that the magnanimous god of 
heaven and earth pagans and all included can possibly 
be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood   im- 
possible   but what is worship   to do the will of 
god   that is worship  and what is the will of god   
to do to my fellow-man what i would have my fellow-man 
to do to me that is the will of god  now  queequeg is 
my fellow- man  and what do i wish that this queequeg 
would do to me   why  unite with me in my particular 
presbyterian form of worship  consequently  i must 
then unite with him in his   ergo  i must turn idolater  
so i kindled the shavings   helped prop up the innocent 
little idol   offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg   
salaamed before him twice or thrice   kissed his nose   
and that done  we undressed and went to bed  at peace 
with our own consciences and all the world  but we 
did not go to sleep without some little chat  

how it is i know not   but there is no place like a bed 
for confidential disclosures between friends  man and 
wife  they say  there open the very bottom of their souls 
to each other   and some old couples often lie and chat 
over old times till nearly morning  thus  then  in our 
hearts  honeymoon  lay i and queequeg a cosy  loving 
pair

nightgown 

we had lain thus in bed  chatting and napping at short 
intervals  and queequeg now and then affectionately 
throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine  and then 
drawing them back   so entirely sociable and free and easy 
were we   when  at last  by reason of our confabulations  
what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed  
and we felt like getting up again  though day-break was 
yet some way down the future  

yes  we became very wakeful   so much so that our 
recumbent position began to grow wearisome  and by 
little and little we found ourselves sitting up   the clothes 
well tucked around us  leaning against the head-board 
with our four knees drawn up close together  and our two 
noses bending over them  as if our knee-pans were warm- 
ing-pans  we felt very nice and snug  the more so since 
it was so chilly out of doors   indeed out of bed-clothes 
too  seeing that there was no fire in the room  the more 
so  i say  because truly to enjoy bodily warmth  some 
small part of you must be cold  for there is no quality 
in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast  
nothing exists in itself  if you flatter yourself that you 
are all over comfortable  and have been so a long time  
then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more  
but if  like queequeg and me in the bed  the tip of your 
nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled  why 
then  indeed  in the general consciousness you feel most 
delightfully and unmistakably warm  for this reason

a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a 
fire  which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich  
for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have 
nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness 
and the cold of the outer air  then there you lie 
like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic 
crystal  

we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some 
time  when all at once i thought i would open my eyes   
for when between sheets  whether by day or by night  
and whether asleep or awake  i have a way of always 
keeping my eyes shut  in order the more to concentrate 
the snugness of being in bed  because no man can ever 
feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed   as 
if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences  
though light be more congenial to our clayey part  upon 
opening my eyes then  and coming out of my own pleasant 
and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse 
outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o clock-at-night  
i experienced a disagreeable revulsion  nor did i at all 
object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best 
to strike a light  seeing that we were so wide awake   and 
besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs 
from his tomahawk  be it said  that though i had felt 
such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the 
night before  yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow 
when love once comes to bend them  for now i liked 
nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me  
even in bed  because he seemed to be full of such serene 
household joy then  i no more felt unduly concerned 
for the landlord s policy of insurance  i was only alive 
to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing 
a pipe and a blanket with a real friend  with our shaggy 
jackets drawn about our shoulders  we now passed the 
tomahawk from one to the other  till slowly there grew 



nightgown 67 

over us a blue hanging tester of smoke  illuminated by 
the flame of the new-lit lamp  

whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the 
savage away to far distant scenes  i know not  but he now 
spoke of his native island   and  eager to hear his history  
i begged him to go on and tell it  he gladly complied  
though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of 
his words  yet subsequent disclosures  when i had become 
more familiar with his broken phraseology  now enable 
me to present the whole story such as it may prove in 
the mere skeleton i give  



chapter xii 

biographical 

queequeg was a native of rokovoko  an island far away 
to the west and south  it is not down in any map   true 
places never are  

when a new-hatched savage running wild about his 
native woodlands in a grass clout  followed by the nib- 
bling goats  as if he were a green sapling   even then  in 
queequeg s ambitious soul  lurked a strong desire to see 
something more of christendom than a specimen whaler 
or two  his father was a high chief  a king   his uncle 
a high priest   and on the maternal side he boasted aunts 
who were the wives of unconquerable warriors  there 
was excellent blood in his veins royal stuff   though 
sadly vitiated  i fear  by the cannibal propensity he 
nourished in his untutored youth  

a sag harbour ship visited his father s bay  and quee- 
queg sought a passage to christian lands  but the ship  
having her full complement of seamen  spurned his suit   
and not all the king his father s influence could prevail  
but queequeg vowed a vow  alone in his canoe  he 
paddled off to a distant strait  which he knew the ship 
must pass through when she quitted the island  on one 
side was a coral reef   on the other a low tongue of land  
covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the 
water  hiding his canoe  still afloat  among these thickets  
with its prow seaward  he sat down in the stern  paddle 
low in hand   and when the ship was gliding by  like a 
flash he darted out   gained her side   with one backward

dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe   climbed 
up the chains   and throwing himself at full length upon 
the deck  grappled a ring-bolt there  and swore not to let 
it go  though hacked in pieces  

in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard   
suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists   queequeg was 
the son of a king  and queequeg budged not  struck 
by his desperate dauntlessness  and his wild desire to visit 
christendom  the captain at last relented  and told him 
he might make himself at home  but this fine young 
savage this sea prince of wales never saw the captain s 
cabin  they put him down among the sailors  and made 
a whaleman of him  but like czar peter content to toil 
in the shipyards of foreign cities  queequeg disdained no 
seeming ignominy  if thereby he might happily gain the 
power of enlightening his untutored countrymen  for at 
bottom so he told me he was actuated by a profound 
desire to learn among the christians  the arts whereby 
to make his people still happier than they were   and more 
than that  still better than they were  but  alas   the 
  practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even 
j christians could be both miserable and wicked   infinitely 
more so  than all his father s heathens  arrived at last 
in old sag harbour   and seeing what the sailors did 
there   and then going on to nantucket  and seeing how 
they spent their wages in that place also  poor queequeg 
gave it up for lost  thought he  it 5 s a wicked world 
in all meridians   1 11 die a pagan  

and thus an old idolater at heart  he yet lived among 
these christians  wore their clothes  and tried to talk their 
gibberish  hence the queer ways about him  though 
now some time from home  

by hints  i asked him whether he did not propose going 
back  and having a coronation   since he might now 
consider his father dead and gone  he being very old and 



70 moby-dick 

feeble at the last accounts  he answered no  not yet   
and added that he was fearful christianity  or rather 
christians  had unfitted him for ascending the pure and 
undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him  but 
by and by  he said  he would return  as soon as he felt 
himself baptized again  for the nonce  however  he 
proposed to sail about  and sow his wild oats in all four 
oceans  they had made a harpooneer of him  and that 
barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now  

i asked him what might be his immediate purpose  
touching his future movements  he answered  to go to 
sea again  in his old vocation  upon this  i told him that 
whaling was my own design  and informed him of my 
intention to sail out of nantucket  as being the most 
promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark 
from  he at once resolved to accompany me to that 
island  ship aboard the same vessel  get into the same 
watch  the same boat  the same mess with me  in short 
to share my every hap   with both my hands in his  boldly 
dip into the potluck of both worlds  to all this i joy- 
ously assented   for besides the affection i now felt for 
queequeg  he was an experienced harpooneer  and as such  
could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who  like me  
was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling  though 
well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant 
seamen  

his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff  
queequeg embraced me  pressed his forehead against 
mine  and blowing out the light  we rolled over from each 
other  this way and that  and very soon were sleeping

wheelbarrow 

next morning  monday  after disposing of the embalmed 
head to a barber  for a block  i settled my own and com- 
rade s bill   using  however  my comrade s money  the 
grinning landlord  as well as the boarders  seemed amaz- 
ingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung 
up between me and queequeg especially as peter coffin s 
cock-and-bull stories about him had previously so much 
alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now 
companied with  

we borrowed a wheelbarrow  and embarking our 
things  including my own poor carpet-bag  and quee- 
queg  s canvas sack and hammock  away we went down to 
the moss  the little nantucket packet schooner moored 
at the wharf  as we were going along the people stared   
not at queequeg so much for they were used to seeing 
cannibals like him in their streets  but at seeing him 
and me upon such confidential terms  but we heeded 
them not  going along wheeling the barrow by turns  
and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath 
on his harpoon barbs  i asked him why he carried such 
a troublesome thing with him ashore  and whether all 
whaling-ships did not find their own harpoons  to this  
in substance  he replied  that though what i hinted was 
true enough  yet he had a particular affection for his own 
harpoon  because it was of assured stuff  well tried in 
many a mortal combat  and deeply intimate with the 
hearts of whales  in short  like many inland reapers and 

71 



72 moby-dick 

mowers  who go into the farmer s meadows armed with 
their own scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish 
them even so  queequeg  for his own private reasons  
preferred his own harpoon  

shifting the barrow from my hand to his  he told me 
a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever 
seen  it was in sag harbour  the owners of his ship  
it seems  had lent him one  in which to carry his heavy 
chest to his boarding-house  not to seem ignorant about 
the thing though in truth he was entirely so  concerning 
the precise way in which to manage the barrow quee- 
queg puts his chest upon it   lashes it fast   and then 
shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf    why  
said i    queequeg  you might have known better than 
that  one would think  didn t the people laugh     

upon this  he told me another story  the people 
of his island of rokovoko  it seems  at their wedding 
feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoa-nuts into 
a large stained calabash like a punch -bowl   and this 
punch -bowl always forms the great central ornament on 
the braided mat where the feast is held  now a certain 
grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko  and its 
commander from all accounts a very stately punctilious 
gentleman  at least for a sea-captain this commander 
was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg  s sister  a 
pretty young princess just turned of ten  well   when all 
the wedding guests were assembled at the bride s bamboo 
cottage  this captain marches in  and being assigned the 
post of honour  placed himself over against the punch- 
bowl  and between the high priest and his majesty the 
king  queequeg  s father  grace being said  for those 
people have their grace as well as we though queequeg 
told me that unlike us  who at such times look downward 
to our platters  they  on the contrary  copying the ducks  
glance upward to the great giver of all feasts grace  



wheelbarrow 73 

i say  being said  the high priest opens the banquet by 
the immemorial ceremony of the island   that is  dipping 
his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl 
before the blessed - beverage circulates  seeing himself 
placed next the priest  and noting the ceremony  and 
thinking himself being captain of a ship as having 
plain precedence over a mere island king  especially in 
the king s own house the captain coolly proceeds to 
wash his hands in the punch-bowl   taking it  i suppose  
for a huge finger-glass    now  said queequeg    what 
you tink now   didn t our people laugh     

at last  passage paid  and luggage safe  we stood on 
board the schooner  hoisting sail  it glided down the 
acushnet river  on one side  new bedford rose in 
terraces of streets  their ice -covered trees all glittering 
in the clear  cold air  huge hills and mountains of casks 
on casks were piled upon her wharves  and side by side 
the world-wandering whale-ships lay silent and safely 
moored at last   while from others came a sound of 
carpenters and coopers  with blended noises of fires and 
forges to melt the pitch  all betokening that new cruises 
were on the start   that one most perilous and long 
voyage ended  only begins a second   and a second ended  
only begins a third  and so on  forever and for aye  
such is the endlessness  yea  the intolerableness of all 
earthly effort  

gaining the more open water  the bracing breeze 
waxed fresh   the little moss tossed the quick foam from 
her bows  as a young colt his snortings  how i snuffed 
that tartar air   how i spurned that turnpike earth   
that common highway all over dented with the marks 
of slavish heels and hoofs   and turned me to admire the 
magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records  

at the same foam-fountain  queequeg seemed to drink 
and reel with me  his dusky nostrils swelled apart   he 



74 moby-dick 

showed his filed and pointed teeth  on  on we flew   and 
our offing gained  the moss did homage to the blast   
ducked and dived her brows as a slave before the sultan  
sideways leaning  we sideways darted   every rope-yarn 
tingling like a wire   the two tall masts buckling like 
indian canes in land tornadoes  so full of this reeling 
scene were we  as we stood by the plunging bowsprit  
that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances 
of the passengers  a lubber-like assembly  who marvelled 
that two fellow-beings should be so companionable   as 
though a white man were anything more dignified than 
a whitewashed negro  but there were some boobies 
and bumpkins there  who  by their intense greenness  
must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure  
queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking 
him behind his back  i thought the bumpkin s hour of 
doom was come  dropping his harpoon  the brawny 
savage caught him in his arms  and by an almost miracu- 
lous dexterity and strength  sent him high up bodily into 
the air   then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset  
the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet  while 
queequeg  turning his back upon him  lighted his toma- 
hawk-pipe and passed it to me for a puff  

  capting   capting     yelled the bumpkin  running 
toward that officer     capting  capting  here  s the 
devil   

  halloa  you sir  cried the captain  a gaunt rib of the 
sea  stalking up to queequeg    what in thunder do you 
mean by that   don t you know you might have killed 
that chap     

  what him say     said queequeg  as he mildly turned 
to me  

  he say   said i    that you came near kill-e that man 
there   pointing to the still shivering greenhorn  

  kill-e  cried queequeg  twisting his tattooed face 



wheelbarrow 75 

into an unearthly expression of disdain    ah   him bevy 
small-e fish-e   queequeg no-kill-e so small-e fish-e   
queequeg idll-e big whale     

  look you  roared the captain    i  11 kill-e you  you 
cannibal  if you try any more of your tricks aboard here   
so mind your eye   

but it so happened just then  that it was high time for 
the captain to mind his own eye  the prodigious strain 
upon the mainsail had parted the weather-sheet  and the 
tremendous boom was now flying from side to side  com- 
pletely sweeping the entire after part of the deck  the 
poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly  
was swept overboard   all hands were in a panic   and to 
attempt snatching at the boom to stay it  seemed madness  
it flew from right to left  and back again  almost in one 
ticking of a watch  and every instant seemed on the point 
of snapping into splinters  nothing was done  and noth- 
ing seemed capable of being done   those on deck rushed 
toward the bows  and stood eyeing the boom as if it were 
the lower jaw of an exasperated whale  in the midst of 
this consternation  queequeg dropped deftly to his knees  
and crawling under the path of the boom  whipped hold 
of a rope  secured one end to the bulwarks  and then 
flinging the other like a lasso  caught it round the boom 
as it swept over his head  and at the next jerk  the spar 
was that way trapped  and all was safe  the schooner 
was run into the wind  and while the hands were clearing 
away the stern boat  queequeg  stripped to the waist  
darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap  for 
three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog  
throwing his long arms straight out before him  and by 
turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing 
foam  i looked at the grand and glorious fellow  but saw 
no one to be saved  the greenhorn had gone down  
shooting himself perpendicularly from the water  quee- 



76 moby-dick 

queg now took an instant s glance around him  and seem- 
ing to see just how matters were  dived down and dis- 
appeared  a few minutes more  and he rose again  one 
arm still striking out  and with the other dragging a life- 
less form  the boat soon picked them up  the poor 
bumpkin was restored  all hands voted queequeg a 
noble trump   the captain begged his pardon  from 
that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle   yea  till 
poor queequeg took his last long dive  

was there ever such unconsciousness   he did not 
seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the 
humane and magnanimous societies  he only asked for 
water fresh water something to wipe the brine off   
that done  he put on dry clothes  lighted his pipe  and 
leaning against the bulwarks  and mildly eyeing those 
around him  seemed to be saying to himself   it  s a 
mutual  joint-stock world  in all meridians  we canni- 
bals must help these christians  5 



chapter xiv 



nantucket 

nothing more happened on the passage worthy the 
mentioning   so  after a fine run  we safely arrived in 
nantucket  

nantucket   take out your map and look at it  
see what a real corner of the world it occupies   how it 
stands there  away off shore  more lonely than the eddy- 
stone lighthouse  look at it a mere hillock  and elbow 
of sand   all beach  without a background  there is 
more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a 
substitute for blotting-paper  some gamesome wights 
will tell you that they have to plant weeds there  they 
don t grow naturally   that they import canada thistles   
that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a 
leak in an oil-cask   that pieces of wood in nantucket 
are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome   
that people there plant toadstools before their houses  
to get under the shade in summer time   that one blade 
of grass makes an oasis  three blades in a day s walk a 
prairie   that they wear quicksand shoes  something like 
laplander snow-shoes   that they are so shut up  belted 
about  every way enclosed  surrounded  and made an 
utter island of by the ocean  that to their very chairs and 
tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering  as 
to the backs of sea-turtles  but these extravaganzas 
only show that nantucket is no illinois  

look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this 
island was settled by the red men  thus goes the legend  

77 



78 moby-dick 

in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new 
england coast  and carried off an infant indian in his 
talons  with loud lament the parents saw their child 
borne out of sight over the wide waters  they resolved 
to follow in the same direction  setting out in their 
canoes  after a perilous passage they discovered the 
island  and there they found an empty ivory casket  
the poor little indian s skeleton  

what wonder  then  that these nantucketers  born on 
a beach  should take to the sea for a livelihood   they 
first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand   grown 
bolder  they waded out with nets for mackerel   more 
experienced  they pushed off in boats and captured cod   
and at last  launching a navy of great ships on the sea  
explored this watery world   put an incessant belt of cir- 
cumnavigations round it   peeped in at behring straits   
and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war 
with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the 
flood   most monstrous and most mountainous   that 
himalayan  salt-sea mastodon  clothed with such por- 
tentousness of unconscious power  that his very panics 
are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious 
assaults   

and thus have these naked nantucketers  these sea- 
hermits  issuing from their ant-hill in the sea  overrun 
and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders   
parcelling out among them the atlantic  pacific  and 
indian oceans  as the three pirate powers did poland  let 
america add mexico to texas  and pile cuba upon canada   
let the english over swarm all india  and hang out their 
blazing banner from the sun  two-thirds of this terr- 
aqueous globe are the nantucketer s  for the sea is his   
he owns it  as emperors own empires   other seamen 
having but a right of way through it  merchant ships 
are but extension bridges   armed ones but floating forts   



nantucket 79 

even pirates and privateers  though following the sea as 
highwaymen the road  they but plunder other ships  other 
fragments of the land like themselves  without seeking to 
draw their living from the bottomless deep itself  the 
nantucketer  he alone resides and riots on the sea   he 
alone  in bible language  goes down to it in ships   to and 
fro ploughing it as his own special plantation  there is 
his home   there lies his business  which a noah s flood 
would not interrupt  though it overwhelmed all the 
millions in china  he lives on the sea  as prairie cocks 
in the prairie   he hides among the waves  he climbs 
them as chamois hunters climb the alps  for years he 
knows not the land   so that when he comes to it at last  
it smells like another world  more strangely than the 
moon would to an earthsman  with the landless gull  
that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep 
between billows   so  at nightfall  the nantucketer  out 
of sight of land  furls his sails  and lays him to his rest  
while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and 
whales  



chapter xv 

chowder 

it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came 
snugly to anchor  and queequeg and i went ashore   so 
we could attend to no business that day  at least none 
but a supper and a bed  the landlord of the spouter- 
inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey 
of the try pots  whom he asserted to be the proprietor 
of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket  and more- 
over he had assured us that cousin hosea  as he called 
him  was famous for his chowders  in short  he plainly 
hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot- 
luck at the try pots  but the directions he had given 
us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard 
hand till we opened a white church to the larboard  and 
then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a 
corner three points to the starboard  and that done  
then ask the first man we met where the place was   these 
crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first  
especially as  at the outset  queequeg insisted that the 
yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be 
left on the larboard hand  whereas i had understood 
peter coffin to say it was on the starboard  however  
by dint of beating about a little in the dark  and now and 
then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the 
way  we at last came to something which there was no 
mistaking  

two enormous wooden pots painted black  and sus- 
pended by asses  ears  swung from the cross-trees of an 

80 






chowder 81 

old topmast  planted in front of an old doorway  the 
horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side  
so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows  
perhaps i was over-sensitive to such impressions at the 
time  but i could not help staring at this gallows with a 
vague misgiving  a sort of crick was in my neck as i 
gazed up to the two remaining horns   yes  two of them  
one for queequeg  and one for me  it  s ominous  thinks 
i  a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first 
whaling port   tombstones staring at me in the whale- 
man s chapel   and here a gallows   and a pair of pro- 
digious black pots too   are these last throwing out 
oblique hints touching tophet   

i was called from these reflections by the sight of a 
freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown  
standing in the porch of the inn  under a dull red lamp 
swinging there  that looked much like an injured eye  
and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple 
woollen shirt  

1 get along with ye  5 said she to the man    or i  11 be 
combing ye     

4 come on  queequeg   said i   all right  there s 
mrs  hussey   

and so it turned out   mr  hosea hussey being from 
home  but leaving mrs  hussey entirely competent to 
attend to all his affairs  upon making known our de- 
sires for a supper and a bed  mrs  hussey  postponing 
further scolding for the present  ushered us into a little 
room  and seating us at a table spread with the relics 
of a recently concluded repast  turned round to us and 
said    clam or cod     

  what  s that about cods  ma am     said i  with much 
politeness  

4 clam or cod     she repeated  

  a clam for supper   a cold clam   is that what you 

vol  i  f 



82 moby-dick 

mean  mrs  hussey     says i     but that  s a rather cold 
and clammy reception in the winter time  ain t it  mrs  
hussey     

but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the 
man in the purple shirt  who was waiting for it in 
the entry  and seeming to hear nothing but the word 
  clam  5 mrs  hussey hurried toward an open door 
leading to the kitchen  and bawling out   clam for two    
disappeared  

  queequeg   said i    do you think that we can make out 
a supper for us both on one clam     

however  a warm savoury steam from the kitchen 
served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before 
us  but when that smoking chowder came in  the 
mystery was delightfully explained  oh  sweet friends   
hearken to me  it was made of small juicy clams  
scarcely bigger than hazel nuts  mixed with pounded ship- 
biscuit  and salted pork cut up into little flakes   the 
whole enriched with butter  and plentifully seasoned with 
pepper and salt  our appetites being sharpened by the 
frosty voyage  and in particular  queequeg seeing his 
favourite fishing food before him  and the chowder being 
surpassingly excellent  we dispatched it with great 
expedition   when leaning back a moment and bethink- 
ing me of mrs  hussey s clam and cod announcement  
i thought i would try a little experiment  stepping 
to the kitchen door  i uttered the word   cod   with great 
emphasis  and resumed my seat  in a few moments the 
savoury steam came forth again  but with a different 
flavour  and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed 
before us  

we resumed business   and while plying our spoons 
in the bowl  thinks i to myself  i wonder now if this here 
has any effect on the head   what  s that stultifying 
saying about chowder-headed people     but look  



chowder 83 

queequeg  ain t that a live eel in your bowl   where  s 
your harpoon     

fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots  which well 
deserved its name   for the pots there were always boiling 
chowders  chowder for breakfast  and chowder for 
dinner  and chowder for supper  till you began to look for 
fish-bones coming through your clothes  the area before 
the house was paved with clam-shells  mrs  hussey wore 
a polished necklace of codfish vertebra   and hosea 
hussey had his account-books bound in superior old 
shark-skin  there was a fishy flavour to the milk  too  
which i could not at all account for  till one morning 
happening to take a stroll along the beach among some 
fishermen s boats  i saw hosea  s brindled cow feeding 
on fish remnants  and marching along the sand with each 
foot in a cod s decapitated head  looking very slipshod  
i assure ye  

supper concluded  we received a lamp  and directions 
from mrs  hussey concerning the nearest way to bed   
but  as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs  
the lady reached forth her arm  and demanded his har- 
poon   she allowed no harpoon in her chambers    why 
not   j said i     every true whaleman sleeps with his 
harpoon but why not       because it  s dangerous  5 
says she    ever since young stiggs coming from that 
unfort nt v y ge of his  when he was gone four years and 
a half  with only three barrels of ile  was found dead in 
my first floor back  with his harpoon in his side   ever 
since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous 
weepons in their rooms at night  so  mr  queequeg   
 for she had learned his name     i will just take this 
here iron  and keep it for you till morning  but the 
chowder   clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast  men     

  both   says i     and let  s have a couple of smoked 
herring by way of variety

the ship 

in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow  but to 
my surprise and no small concern  queequeg now gave 
me to understand  that he had been diligently consulting 
yojo the name of his black little god and yojo had 
told him two or three times over  and strongly insisted 
upon it everyway  that instead of our going together 
among the whaling-fleet in harbour  and in concert 
selecting our craft   instead of this  i say  yojo earnestly 
enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly 
with me  inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us   and  
in order to do so  had already pitched upon a vessel  which  
if left to myself  i  ishmael  should infallibly light upon  
for all the world as though it had turned out by chance   
and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself  for 
the present irrespective of queequeg  

i have forgotten to mention that  in many things  
queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of 
yojo s judgment and surprising forecast of things   and 
cherished yojo with considerable esteem  as a rather 
good sort of god  who perhaps meant well enough upon 
the whole  but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent 
designs  

now  this plan of queequeg s  or rather yojo s  touch- 
ing the selection of our craft   i did not like that plan at 
all  i had not a little relied upon queequeg s sagacity 
to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our 
fortunes securely  but as all my remonstrances pro-

the ship 85 

duced no effect upon queequeg  i was obliged to acquiesce  
and accordingly prepared to set about this business with 
a determined rushing sort of energy and vigour  that 
should quickly settle that trifling little affair  next 
morning early  leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in 
our little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort 
of lent or ramadan  or day of fasting  humiliation  and 
prayer with queequeg and yojo that day   how it was 
i never could find out  for  though i applied myself to 
it several times  i never could master his liturgies and 
xxxix articles leaving queequeg  then  fasting on 
his tomahawk-pipe  and yojo warming himself at his 
sacrificial fire of shavings  i sallied out among the shipping  
after much prolonged sauntering and many random 
inquiries  i learnt that there were three ships up for 
three-years  voyages the devil-dam  the tit-bit  and 
the pequod  devil-dam  i do not know the origin of   
tit-bit is obvious   pequod  you will no doubt remember  
was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts 
indians  now extinct as the ancient medes  i peered and 
pryed about the devil-dam   from her  hopped over to 
the tit-bit   and  finally  going on board the pequod  
looked around her for a moment  and then decided that 
this was the very ship for us  

you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day  
for aught i know   square-toed luggers   mountainous 
japanese junks   butter-box galliots  and what not   but 
take my word for it  you never saw such a rare old craft 
as this same rare old pequod  she was a ship of the old 
school  rather small if anything   with an old-fashioned 
claw-footed look about her  long seasoned and weather- 
stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans  her 
old hull s complexion was darkened like a french grena- 
dier s  who has alike fought in egypt and siberia  her 
venerable bows looked bearded  her masts cut some- 



86 moby-dick 

where on the coast of japan  where her original ones were 
lost overboard in a gale her masts stood stiffly up like 
the spines of the three old kings of cologne  her ancient 
decks were worn and wrinkled  like the pilgrim-worshipped 
flag-stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled  
but to all these her old antiquities were added new and 
marvellous features  pertaining to the wild business that 
for more than half a century she had followed  old 
captain peleg  many years her chief mate  before he com- 
manded another vessel of his own  and now a retired 
seaman  and one of the principal owners of the pequod  
this old peleg  during the term of his chief mateship  had 
built upon her original grotesqueness  and inlaid it  all 
over  with a quaintness both of material and device  un- 
matched by anything except it be thorkill-hake s carved 
buckler or bedstead  she was apparelled like any bar- 
baric ethiopian emperor  his neck heavy with pendants 
of polished ivory  she was a thing of trophies  a canni- 
bal of a craft  tricking herself forth in the chased bones 
of her enemies  all round  her unpanelled  open bul- 
warks were garnished like one continuous jaw  with the 
long sharp teeth of the sperm whale  inserted there for 
pins  to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to  
those thews ran not through base blocks of land-wood  
but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea -ivory  scorning 
a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm  she sported there 
a tiller   and that tiller was in one mass  curiously carved 
from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe  
the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest  
felt like the tartar  when he holds back his fiery steed 
by clutching its jaw  a noble craft  but somehow a most 
melancholy   all noble things are touched with that  

now when i looked about the quarter-deck  for some 
one having authority  in order to propose myself as a 
candidate for the voyage  at first i saw nobody   but i 



the ship 87 

could not well overlook a strange sort of tent  or rather 
wigwam  pitched a little behind the mainmast  it 
seemed only a temporary erection used in port  it was 
of a conical shape  some ten feet high   consisting of the 
long  huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the 
middle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale  
planted with their broad ends on the deck  a circle of these 
slabs laced together  mutually sloped toward each other  
and at the apex united in a tufted point  where the loose 
hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some 
old pottowottamie sachem s head  a triangular opening 
faced toward the bows of the ship  so that the insider 
commanded a complete view forward  

and half concealed in this queer tenement  i at length 
found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority   
and who  it being noon  and the ship s work suspended  
was now enjoying respite from the burden of command  
he was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair  wriggling 
all over with curious carving   and the bottom of which 
was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff 
of which the wigwam was constructed  

there was nothing so very particular  perhaps  about 
the appearance of the elderly man i saw   he was brown 
and brawny  like most old seamen  and heavily rolled up 
in blue pilot-cloth  cut in the quaker style   only there 
was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest 
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes  which must have 
arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales  and 
always looking to windward   for this causes the muscles 
about the eyes to become pursed together  such eye- 
wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl  

  is this the captain of the pequod     said i  advancing 
to the door of the tent  

  supposing it be the captain of the pequod  what 
dost thou want of him     he demanded  



88 moby-dick 

  i was thinking of shipping   

  thou wast  wast thou   i see thou art no nan- 
tucketer ever been in a stove boat     

  no  sir  i never have   

  dost know nothing at all about whaling  i dare say 
eh    

  nothing  sir   but i have no doubt i shall soon learn  
i  ve been several voyages in the merchant service  and 
i think that 

  marchant service be damned  talk not that lingo 
to me  dost see that leg   i  11 take that leg away from 
thy stern  if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to 
me again  marchant service indeed   i suppose now 
ye feel considerable proud of having served in those 
marchant ships  but flukes   man  what makes thee 
want to go a-whaling  eh   it looks a little suspicious  
don t it  eh   hast not been a pirate  hast thou   
didst not rob thy last captain  didst thou   dost not 
think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea     

i protested my innocence of these things  i saw that 
under the mask of these half-humorous innuendoes  this 
old seaman  as an insulated quakerish nantucketer  was 
full of his insular prejudices  and rather distrustful of all 
aliens  unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard  

  but what takes thee a-whaling   i want to know that 
before i think of shipping ye   

4 well  sir  i want to see what whaling is  i want to 
see the world  

  want to see what whaling is  eh   have ye clapped 
eye on captain ahab     

  who is captain ahab  sir     

4 ay  ay  i thought so  captain ahab is the captain 
of this ship   

  i am mistaken then  i thought i was speaking to 
the captain himself   



the ship 89 

  thou art speaking to captain peleg that  s who ye 
are speaking to  young man  it belongs to me and 
captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage  
and supplied with all her needs  including crew  we are 
part owners and agents  but as i was going to say  if 
thou wantest to know what whaling is  as thou tellest ye 
do  i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind 
yourself to it  past backing out  clap eye on captain 
ahab  young man  and thou wilt finxl that he has only 
one leg   

  what do you mean  sir   was the other one lost by 
a whale     

  lost by a whale   young man  come nearer to me   
it was devoured  chewed up  crunched by the mon- 
strousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat   ah  ah     

i was a little alarmed by his energy  perhaps also a little 
touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation  
but said as calmly as i could    what you say is no doubt 
true enough  sir   but how could i know there was any 
peculiar ferocity in that particular whale  though indeed 
i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of 
the accident   

  look ye now  young man  thy lungs are a sort of soft  
d  ye see   thou dost not talk shark a bit  sure  ye  ve 
been to sea before now   sure of that     

  sir   said i    i thought i told you that i had been four 
voyages in the merchant   

  hard down out of that   mind what i said about the 
marchant service don t aggravate me i won t have it  
but let us understand each other  i have given thee a 
hint about what whaling is   do ye yet feel inclined for it     

4 1 do  sir   

  very good  now  art thou the man to pitch a 
harpoon down a live whale s throat  and then jump 
after it   answer  quick     



90 moby-dick 

  i am  sir  if it should be positively indispensable to 
do so   not to be got rid of  that is   which i don t take 
to be the fact   

6 good again  now then  thou not only wantest to go 
a -whaling  to find out by experience what whaling is  
but ye also want to go in order to see the world   was 
not that what ye said   i thought so  well then  just 
step forward there  and take a peep over the weather-bow  
and then back to me and tell me what ye see there   

for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious 
request  not knowing exactly how to take it  whether 
humorously or in earnest  but concentrating all his 
crow s feet into one scowl  captain peleg started me on 
the errand  

going forward and glancing over the weather -bow  i 
perceived that the ship  swinging to her anchor with the 
flood-tide  was now obliquely pointing toward the open 
ocean  the prospect was unlimited  but exceedingly 
monotonous and forbidding   not the slightest variety 
that i could see  

  well  what  s the report     said peleg when i came 
back     what did ye see     

1 not much   i replied  nothing but water   considerable 
horizon though  and there  s a squall coming up  i think   

  well  what dost thou think then of seeing the world   
do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of it  
i eh   can t ye see the world where you stand     

i was a little staggered  but go a-whaling i must  and 
i would   and the pequod was as good a ship as any i 

 thought the best and all this i now repeated to peleg  
seeing me so determined  he expressed his willingness to 
ship me  

  and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off    he 
added   come along with ye   and so saying  he led 
the way below deck into the cabin  



the ship 91 

seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most 
uncommon and surprising figure  it turned out to be 
captain bildad  who along with captain peleg was one 
of the largest owners of the vessel   the other shares  as 
is sometimes the case in these ports  being held by a 
crowd of old annuitants   widows  fatherless children  
and chancery wards   each owning about the value of a 
timber head  or a foot of plank  or a nail or two in the ship  
people in nantucket invest their money in whaling- 
vessels  the same way that you do yours in approved 
state stocks bringing in good interest  

now bildad  like peleg  and indeed many other nan- 
tucketers  was a quaker  the island having been originally 
settled by that sect   and to this day its inhabitants in 
general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities 
of the quaker  only variously and anomalously modified 
by things altogether alien and heterogeneous  for some 
of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all 
sailors and whale -hunters  they are fighting quakers   
they are quakers with a vengeance  

so that there are instances among them of men  who  
named with scripture names a singularly common 
fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbib- 
ing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker 
idiom   still  from the audacious  daring  and boundless 
adventure of their subsequent lives  strangely blend with 
these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes 
of character  not unworthy a scandinavian sea-king  or a 
poetical pagan roman  and when these things unite 
in a man of greatly superior natural force  with a globular 
brain and a ponderous heart   who has also by the still- 
ness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the 
remotest waters  and beneath constellations never seen 
here at the north  been led to think untraditionally and 
independently   receiving all nature s sweet or savage 



92 moby-dick 

impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and 
confiding breast  and thereby chiefly  but with some help 
from accidental advantages  to learn a bold and nervous 
lofty language that man makes one in a whole nation s 
census a mighty pageant creature  formed for noble 
tragedies  nor will it at all detract from him  dramatic- 
ally regarded  if either by birth or other circumstances  he 
have what seems a half- wilful over-ruling morbidness at 
the bottom of his nature  for all men tragically great 
are made so through a certain morbidness  be sure of 
this  young ambition  all mortal greatness is but disease  
but  as yet we have not to do with such an one  but with 
quite another   and still a man  who  if indeed peculiar  
it only results again from another phase of the quaker  
modified by individual circumstances  

like captain peleg  captain bildad was a well-to-do  
retired whaleman  but unlike captain peleg who 
cared not a rush for what are called serious things  and 
indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest 
of all trifles captain bildad had not only been originally 
educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket 
quakerism  but all his subsequent ocean life   and the sight 
of many unclad  lovely island creatures  round the horn 
all that had not moved this native-born quaker one 
single jot  had not so much as altered one angle of his vest  
still  for all this immutableness  was there some lack of 
common consistency about worthy captain bildad  
though refusing  from conscientious scruples  to bear 
arms against land invaders  yet himself had illimitably 
invaded the atlantic and pacific   and though a sworn 
foe to human bloodshed  yet had he in his straight -bodied 
coat  spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore  how 
now in the contemplative evening of his days  the pious 
bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence  i do 
not know   but it did not seem to concern him much  






the ship 93 

and very probably he had long since come to the sage and 
sensible conclusion that a oman s religion is one thing  
and this practical world quite another  this world pays 
dividends  rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes 
of the drabbest drab  to a harpooneer in a broad shad- 
bellied waistcoat   from that becoming boat-header  
chief mate  and captain  and finally a shipowner   bildad  
as i hinted before  had concluded his adventurous career 
by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of 
sixty  and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet 
receiving of his well-earned income  

now bildad  i am sorry to say  had the reputation of 
being an incorrigible old hunks  and in his sea -going days  
a bitter  hard taskmaster  they told me in nantucket  
though it certainly seems a curious story  that when he 
sailed the old categut whaleman  his crew  upon arriving 
home  were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital  
sore exhausted and worn out  for a pious man  especi- v 
ally for a quaker  he was certainly rather hard-hearted  to   
say the least  he never used to swear  though  at his 
men  they said   but somehow he got an inordinate 
quantity of cruel  unmitigated hard work out of them  
when bildad was a chief mate  to have his drab-coloured 
eye intently looking at you  made you feel completely 
nervous  till you could clutch something a hammer or a 
marling-spike and go to work like mad  at something or 
other  never mind what  indolence and idleness perished 
from before him  his own person was the exact embodi- 
ment of his utilitarian character  on his long  gaunt 
body he carried no spare flesh  no superfluous beard  
his chin having a soft  economical nap to it  like the worn 
nap of his broad-brimmed hat  

such  then  was the person that i saw seated on the 
transom when i followed captain peleg down into the 
cabin  the space between the decks was small   and 



94 moby-dick 

there  bolt-upright  sat old bildad  who always sat so  
and never leaned  and this to save his coat-tails  his 
broad-brim was placed beside him   his legs were stiffly 
crossed   his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin   
and spectacles on nose  he seemed absorbed in reading 
from a ponderous volume  

  bildad   cried captain peleg    at it again  bildad  eh   
ye have been studying those scriptures  now  for the last 
thirty years  to my certain knowledge  how far ye got  
bildad     

as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old 
shipmate  bildad  without noticing his present irreverence  
quietly looked up  and seeing me  glanced again inquiringly 
toward peleg  

4 he says he  s our man  bildad  said peleg    he wants 
to ship  5 

  dost thee     said bildad  in a hollow tone  and turning 
round to me  

  i dost  said i unconsciously  he was so intense a 
quaker  

  what do ye think of him  bildad     said peleg  

  he  11 do   said bildad  eyeing me  and then went on 
spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite 
audible  

i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw  
especially as peleg  his friend and old shipmate  seemed 
such a blusterer  but i said nothing  only looking round 
me sharply  peleg now threw open a chest  and drawing 
forth the ship s articles  placed pen and ink before him  
and seated himself at a little table  i began to think 
it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i 
would be willing to engage for the voyage  i was already 
aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages   
but all hands  including the captain  received certain 
shares of the profits called lays  and that these lays were 



the ship 95 

proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to 
the respective duties of the ship s company  i was also 
aware that being a green-hand at whaling  my own lay 
would not be very large   but considering that i was used 
to the sea  could steer a ship  splice a rope  and all that  
i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be 
offered at least the 275th lay that is  the 275th part of 
the clear nett proceeds of the voyage  whatever that 
might eventually amount to  and though the 275th 
lay was what they call a rather long lay  yet it was better 
than nothing   and if we had a lucky voyage  might 
pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it  
not to speak of my three years  beef and board  for which 
i would not have to pay one stiver  

it might be thought that this was a poor way to 
accumulate a princely fortune and so it was  a very poor 
way indeed  but i am one of those that never take on 
about princely fortunes  and am quite content if the world 
is ready to board and lodge me  while i am putting up at 
this grim sign of the thunder cloud  upon the whole  i 
thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing  
but would not have been surprised had i been offered 
the 200th  considering i was of a broad-shouldered make  

but one thing  nevertheless  that made me a little 
distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits 
was this   ashore  i had heard something of both captain 
peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad   how that 
they being the principal proprietors of the pequod  there- 
fore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered 
owners  left nearly the whole management of the ship s 
affairs to these two  and i did not know but what the 
stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about 
shipping hands  especially as i now found him on board 
the pequod  quite at home there in the cabin  and reading 
his bible as if at his own fireside  now while peleg was 



96 moby-dick 

vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife  old bildad  
to my no small surprise  considering that he was such an 
interested party in these proceedings   bildad never 
heeded us  but went on mumbling to himself out of his 
book    lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth  
where moth   

  well  captain bildad   interrupted peleg    what d  ye 
say  what lay shall we give this young man     

  thou knowest best   was the sepulchral reply    the 
seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn t be too 
much  would it     where moth and rust do corrupt  
but lay     

lay  indeed  thought i  and such a lay   the seven 
hundred and seventy-seventh   well  old bildad  you 
are determined that i  for one  shall not lay up many lays 
here below  where moth and rust do corrupt  it was an 
exceedingly long lay that  indeed   and though from the 
magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a lands- 
man  yet the slightest consideration will show that though 
seven hundred and seventy -seven is a pretty large num- 
ber  yet  when you come to make a teenth of it  you will 
then see  i say  that the seven hundred and seventy- 
seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven 
hundred and seventy -seven gold doubloons   and so i 
thought at the time  

4 why  blast your eyes  bildad   cried peleg    thou dost 
not want to swindle this young man   he must have more 
than that   

  seven hundred and seventy -seventh   again said 
bildad  without lifting his eyes   and then went on 
mumbling   for where your treasure is  there will your 
heart be also   

  i am going to put him down for the three hundredth   
said peleg    do ye hear that  bildad   the three hundredth 
lay  i say   






the ship 97 

bildad laid down his book  and turning solemnly to- 
ward him said    captain peleg  thou hast a generous 
heart   but thou must consider the duty thou owest to 
the other owners of this ship widows and orphans  many 
of them and that if we too abundantly reward the 
labours of this young man  we may be taking the bread 
from those widows and those orphans  the seven 
hundred and seventy -seventh lay  captain peleg   

  thou bildad     roared peleg  starting up and clattering 
about the cabin    blast ye  captain bildad  if i had 
followed thy advice in these matters  i would afore now 
had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy 
enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round 
cape horn   

4 captain peleg   said bildad steadily    thy conscience 
may be drawing ten inches of water  or ten fathoms  i 
can t tell   but as thou art still an impenitent man  
captain peleg  i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but 
a leaky one   and will in the end sink thee foundering 
down to the fiery pit  captain peleg   

  fiery pit   fiery pit   ye insult me  man   past all 
natural bearing  ye insult me  it  s an all-fired outrage

as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad  but 
with a marvellous oblique  sliding celerity  bildad for 
that time eluded him  

alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two 
principal and responsible owners of the ship  and feeling 
half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so 
questionably owned and temporarily commanded  i

stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad  who  
i made no doubt  was all eagerness to vanish from before 
the awakened wrath of peleg  but to my astonishment  
he sat down again on the transom very quietly  and seemed 
to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing  he 
seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways  as 
for peleg  after letting off his rage as he had  there seemed 
no more left in him  and he  too  sat down like a lamb  
though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated  
  whew     he whistled at last   the squall  s gone off to 
leeward  i think  bildad  thou used to be good at 
sharpening a lance  mend that pen  will ye  my jack- 
knife here needs the grindstone  that  s he   thank ye  
bildad  now then  my young man  ishmael  s thy name  
didn t ye say   well then  down ye go here  ishmael  
for the three hundredth lay   

  captain peleg   said i    i have a friend with me who 
wants to ship too shall i bring him down to-morrow     

  to be sure   said peleg    fetch him along  and we  11 
look at him   

  what lay does he want     groaned bildad  glancing 
up from the book in which he had again been burying 
himself  

  oh   never thee mind about that  bildad   said peleg  
  has he ever whaled it any     turning to me  

  killed more whales than i can count  captain peleg   

  well  bring him along then   

and  after signing the papers  off i went   nothing 
doubting but that i had done a good morning s work  
and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo 
had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape  

but i had not proceeded far  when i began to bethink 
me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained 
unseen by me   though  indeed  in many cases  a whale- 
ship will be completely fitted out  and receive all her crew 






the ship 99 

on board  ere the captain makes himself visible by arriv- 
ing to take command   for sometimes these voyages are 
so prolonged  and the shore intervals at home so exceed- 
ingly brief  that if the captain have a family  or any 
absorbing concernment of that sort  he does not trouble 
himself much about his ship in port  but leaves her to 
the owners till all is ready for sea  however  it is always 
as well to have a look at him before irrevocably commit- 
ting yourself into his hands  turning back i accosted 
captain peleg  inquiring where captain ahab was to be 
found  

  and what dost thou want of captain ahab   it  s 
all right enough   thou art shipped   

  yes  but i should like to see him  3 

  but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present  i 
don t know exactly what  s the matter with him   but 
he keeps close inside the house   a sort of sick  and yet he 
don t look so  in fact  he ain t sick   but no  he isn t well 
either  anyhow  young man  he won t always see me  
so i don t suppose he will thee  he  s a queer man  
captain ahab so some think but a good one  oh  
thou  it like him well enough   no fear  no fear  he  s a 
grand  ungodly  god-like man  captain ahab   doesn t 
speak much   but  when he does speak  then you may well 
listen  mark ye  be forewarned   ahab  s above the 
common   ahab  s been in colleges  as well as  mong the 
cannibals   been used to deeper wonders than the waves   
fixed his fiery lance hi mightier  stranger foes than whales  
his lance   ay  the keenest and the surest that out of 
all our isle   oh   he ain t captain bildad   no  and he 
ain t captain peleg   he  s ahab  boy   and ahab of old  
thou knowest  was a crowned king     

  and a very vile one  when that wicked king was 
slain  the dogs  did they not lick his blood     

1 come hither to me hither  hither   said peleg  with 



100 moby-dick 

a significance in his eye that almost startled me    look 
ye  lad   never say that on board the pequod  never say 
it anywhere  captain ahab did not name himself  
 twas a foolish  ignorant whim of his crazy  widowed 
mother  who died when he was only a twelvemonth old  
and yet the old squaw tistig  at gay head  said that the 
name would somehow prove prophetic  and  perhaps  
other fools like her may tell thee the same  i wish to 
warn thee  it  s a lie  i know captain ahab well   i  ve 
sailed with him as mate years ago   i know what he is a 
good man not a pious  good man  like bildad  but a 
swearing good man something like me only there  s a 
good deal more of him  ay  ay  i know that he was 
never very jolly   and i know that on the passage home  
he was a little out of his mind for a spell   but it was the 
sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought 
that about  as anyone might see  i know  too  that ever 
since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale  
he   s been a kind of moody desperate moody  and savage 
sometimes   but that will all pass off  and once for all  
let me tell thee and assure thee  young man  it  s better 
to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad 
one  so good-bye to thee and wrong not captain 
ahab  because he happens to have a wicked name  be- 
sides  my boy  he has a wife not three voyages wedded 
a  sweet  resigned girl  think of that   by that sweet 
girl that old man has a child   hold ye then there can be 
any utter  hopeless harm in ahab   no  no  my lad   
stricken  blasted  if he be  ahab has his humanities     

as i walked away  i was full of thoughtfuhiess   what 
had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab  
filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness 
concerning him  and somehow  at the time  i felt a 
sympathy and a sorrow for him  but for i don t know 
what   unless it was the cruel loss of his leg  and yet i 






the ship 101 

also felt a strange awe of him   but that sort of awe  
which i cannot at all describe  was not exactly awe   i 
do not know what it was  but i felt it   and it did not 
disincline me toward him   though i felt impatience 
at what seemed like mystery in him  so imperfectly as 
he was known to me then  however  my thoughts were 
at length carried in other directions  so that for the present 
dark ahab slipped my mind  



chapter xvii 

the ramadan 

as queequeg  s ramadan  or fasting and humiliation  
was to continue all day  i did not choose to disturb him 
till toward night -fall   for i cherish the greatest respect 
toward everybody s religious obligations  never mind 
how comical  and could not find it in my heart to under- 
value even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad- 
stool   or those other creatures in certain parts of our 
earth  who with a degree of footmanism quite unpre- 
cedented in other planets  bow down before the torso 
of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of 
the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his 
name  

i say  we good presbyterian christians should be 
charitable in these things  and not fancy ourselves so 
vastly superior to other mortals  pagans and what not  
because of their half -crazy conceits on these subjects  
there was queequeg  now  certainly entertaining the most 
absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan   but what 
of that   queequeg thought he knew what he was about  
i suppose   he seemed to be content   and there let him 
rest  all our arguing with him would not avail   let him 
be  i say   and heaven have mercy on us all presby- 
terians and pagans alike for we are all somehow dread- 
fully cracked about the head  and sadly need mending  

toward evening  when i felt assured that all his 
performances and rituals must be over  i went up to his 
room and knocked at the door   but no answer  i tried 
102 



i 



the ramadan 103 

to open it  but it was fastened inside    queequeg   said i 
softly through the keyhole   all silent    i say  quee- 
queg   why don t you speak   it  s i ishmael   but 
all remained still as before  i began to grow alarmed  i 
had allowed him such abundant time   i thought he might 
have had an apoplectic fit  i looked through the key- 
hole   but the door opening into an odd corner of the 
room  the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister 
one  i could only see part of the foot-board of the bed 
and a line of the wall  but nothing more  i was surprised 
to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of quee- 
queg  s harpoon  which the landlady the evening previous 
had taken from him  before our mounting to the chamber  
that  s strange  thought i   but at any rate  since the 
harpoon stands yonder  and he seldom or never goes 
abroad without it  therefore he must be inside here  and 
no possible mistake  

  queequeg   queequeg     all still  something must 
have happened  apoplexy   i tried to burst open the 
door   but it stubbornly resisted  running downstairs  
i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i met 
the chambermaid    la   la     she cried    i thought 
something must be the matter  i went to make the bed 
after breakfast  and the door was locked   and not a 
mouse to be heard   and it  s been just so silent ever since  
but i thought  maybe  you had both gone off and locked 
your baggage in for safe keeping  la   la  ma am   
mistress   murder   mrs  hussey   apoplexy     and 
with these cries  she ran toward the kitchen  i following  

mrs  hussey soon appeared  with a mustard-pot in one 
hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other  having just broken 
away from the occupation of attending to the castors  
and scolding her little black boy meantime  

  wood-house     cried i    which way to it   run  for 
god s sake  and fetch something to pry open the door 



104 moby-dick 

the axe   the axe   he  s had a stroke   depend upon 
it     and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up- 
stairs again empty-handed  when mrs  hussey interposed 
the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet  and the entire castor 
of her countenance  

  what j s the matter with you  young man     

  get the axe   for god s sake  run for the doctor  
someone  while i pry it open     

  look here  said the landlady  quickly putting down 
the vinegar-cruet  so as to have one hand free     look 
here   are you talking about prying open any of my 
doors     and with that she seized my arm    what  s 
the matter with you   what  s the matter with you  
shipmate     

in as calm  but rapid a manner as possible  i gave her 
to understand the whole case  unconsciously clapping 
the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose  she ruminated 
for an instant   then exclaimed 4 no   i haven t seen it 
since i put it there   running to a little closet under the 
landing of the stairs  she glanced in  and returning  told 
me that queequeg s harpoon was missing    he  s killed 
himself   she cried    it  s unfort nate stiggs done over 
again there goes another counterpane god pity his 
poor mother   it will be the ruin of my house  has 
the poor lad a sister   where  s that girl   there  betty  
go to snarles the painter  and tell him to paint me a sign  
with   no suicides permitted here  and no smoking in 
the parlour     might as well kill both birds at once  
kill   the lord be merciful to his ghost   what  s 
that noise there   you  young man  avast there     

and running after me  she caught me as i was again 
trying to force open the door  

  i won t allow it   i won t have my premises spoiled  
go for the locksmith  there  s one about a mile from here  
but avast     putting her hand in her side-pocket    here  s 



the ramadan 105 

a key that  11 fit  i guess   let  s see   and with that  she 
turned it in the lock   but  alas   queequeg  s supple- 
mental bolt remained unwithdrawn within  

6 have to burst it open   said i  and was running down 
the entry a little  for a good start  when the landlady 
caught at me  again vowing i should not break down her 
premises   but i tore from her  and with a sudden bodily 
rush dashed myself full against the mark  

with a prodigious noise the door flew open  and the 
knob slamming against the wall  sent the plaster to the 
ceiling   and there  good heavens   there sat queequeg  
altogether cool and self-collected   right in the middle 
of the room   squatting on his hams  and holding yojo 
on top of his head  he looked neither one way nor the 
other way  but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign 
of active life  

  queequeg  said i  going up to him    queequeg  what  s 
the matter with you     

  he hain t been a-sittin  so all day  has he     said the 
landlady  

but all we said  not a word could we drag out of him   
i almost felt like pushing him over  so as to change his 
position  for it was almost intolerable  it seemed so pain- 
fully and unnaturally constrained   especially  as in all 
probability he had been sitting so for upward of eight or 
ten hours  going too without his regular meals  

 mrs  hussey   said i   he s alive  at all events  so 
leave us  if you please  and i will see to this strange affair 
myself   

closing the door upon the landlady  i endeavoured to 
 revail upon queequeg to take a chair   but in vain  
there he sat   and all he could do for all my polite 
arts and blandishments he would not move a peg  nor 
say a single word  nor even look at me  nor notice my 
presence in any the slightest way  



106 moby-dick 

i wonder  thought i  if this can possibly be a part of his 
ramadan   do they fast on their hams that way in his 
native island   it must be so   yes  it  s part of his 
creed  i suppose   well  then  let him rest   he  11 get up 
sooner or later  no doubt  it can t last for ever  thank 
god  and his ramadan only comes once a year   and i 
don t believe it  s very punctual then  

i went down to supper  after sitting a long time 
listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just 
come from a plum-pudding voyage  as they called it  that 
is  a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig  confined 
to the north of the line  in the atlantic ocean only    after 
listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven 
o clock  i went upstairs to go to bed  feeling quite sure 
by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his 
ramadan to a termination  but no   there he was just 
where i had left him   he had not stirred an inch  i began 
to grow vexed with him   it seemed so downright sense- 
less and insane to be sitting there all day and half the 
night on his hams in a cold room  holding a piece of wood 
on his head  

  for heaven s sake  queequeg  get up and shake your- 
self   get up and have some supper  you 11 starve   
you  11 kill yourself  queequeg   but not a word did he 
reply  

despairing of him  therefore  i deter mined to go to bed 
and to sleep   and no doubt  before a great while  he 
would follow me  but previous to turning in  i took my 
heavy bearskin jacket  and threw it over him  as it 
promised to be a very cold night   and he had nothing 
but his ordinary round jacket on  for some time  do 
all i would  i could not get into the faintest doze  i had 
blown out the candle   and the mere thought of queequeg 
not four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position  
stark alone in the cold and dark   this made me really 



the ramadan 107 

wretched  think of it   sleeping all night in the same 
room with a wide-awake pagan on his hams in this dreary  
unaccountable ramadan   

but somehow i dropped off at last  and knew nothing 
more till break of day   when  looking over the bedside  
there squatted queequeg  as if he had been screwed down 
to the floor  but as soon as the first glimpse of sun 
entered the window  up he got  with stiff and grating 
joints  but with a cheerful look   limped toward me where 
i lay   pressed his forehead again against mine   and said 
his ramadan was over  

now  as i before hinted  i have no objection to any 
person s religion  be it what it may  so long as that person 
does not kill or insult any other person  because that other 
person don t believe it also  but when a man s religion 
becomes really frantic   when it is a positive torment to 
him   and  in fine  makes this earth of ours an uncom- 
fortable inn to lodge in   then i think it high time to take 
that individual aside and argue the point with him  

and just so i now did with queequeg    queequeg   
said i    get into bed now  and lie and listen to me   i 
then went on  beginning with the rise and progress of 
the primitive religions  and coming down to the various 
religions of the present time  during which time i laboured 
to show queequeg that all these lents  ramadans  and 
prolonged ham-squattings in cold  cheerless rooms were 
stark nonsense   bad for the health   useless for the soul   
opposed  in short  to the obvious laws of hygiene and 
common-sense  i told him  too  that he being in other 
things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage  
it pained me  very badly pained me  to see him now so 
deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his  
besides  argued i  fasting makes the body cave in   hence 
the spirit caves in   and all thoughts born of a fast must 
necessarily be half -starved  this is the reason why most 






108 moby-dick 

dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions 
about their hereafters  in one word  queequeg  said i  
rather digressively   hell is an idea first born on an un- 
digested apple-dumpling   and since then perpetuated 
through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by bamadans  

i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever 
troubled with dyspepsia   expressing the idea very plainly  
so that he could take it in  he said no   only upon one 
memorable occasion  it was after a great feast given 
by his father the king  on the gaming of a great battle 
wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two 
o clock in the afternoon  and all cooked and eaten that 
very evening  

4 no more  queequeg   said i  shuddering    that will 
do     for i knew the inferences without his further hint- 
ing them  i had seen a sailor who had visited that very 
island  and he told me that it was the custom  when a 
great battle had been gained there  to barbecue all the 
slain in the yard or garden of the victor   and then  one 
by one  they were placed in great wooden trenchers  and 
garnished round like a pilau  with breadfruit and cocoa- 
nuts   and with some parsley in their mouths  were sent 
round with the victor s compliments to all his friends  
just as though these presents were so many christmas 
turkeys  

after all  i do not think that my remarks about religion 
made much impression upon queequeg  because  in 
the first place  he somehow seemed dull of hearing on 
that important subject  unless considered from his own 
point of view   and  in the second place  he did not more 
than one-third understand me  couch my ideas simply as 
i would   and  finally  he no doubt thought he knew a 
good deal more about the true religion than i did  he 
looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and 
compassion  as though he thought it a great pity that such 



the ramadan 109 

a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to 
evangelical pagan piety  

at last we rose and dressed   and queequeg  taking a 
prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts  so 
that the landlady should not make much profit by reason 
of his ramadan  we sallied out to board the pequod  
sauntering along  and picking our teeth with halibut 
bones  



chapter xviii 

his mark 

as we were walking down the end of the wharf toward 
the ship  queequeg carrying his harpoon  captain peleg 
in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam  saying 
he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal  and 
furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on 
board that craft  unless they previously produced their 
papers  

  what do you mean by that  captain peleg     said i  
now jumping on the bulwarks  and leaving my comrade 
standing on the wharf  

  i mean   he replied    he must show his papers   

  yea   said captain bildad in his hollow voice  sticking 
his head from behind peleg  s  out of the wigwam    he 
must show that he  s converted  son of darkness  he 
added  turning to queequeg  c art thou at present in 
communion with any christian church     

  why  said i    he  s a member of the first congrega- 
tional church  here be it said  that many tattooed 
savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be 
converted into the churches  

  first congregational church  cried bildad    what   
that worships in deacon deuteronomy cole man s meeting- 
house     and so saying  taking out his spectacles  he rubbed 
them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief  and 
putting them on very carefully  came out of the wigwam  
and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks  took a good long 
look at queequeg  
iip 



his mark 111 

  how long hath he been a member     he then said  
turning to me     not very long  i rather guess  young 
man   

4 no  said peleg    and he hasn t been baptized right 
either  or it would have washed some of that devil s blue 
off his face   

  do tell  now  cried bildad    is this philistine a 
regular member of deacon deuteronomy s meeting   
i never saw him going there  and i pass it every lord s 
day   

  i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy 
or his meeting  said i    all i know is  that queequeg here 
is a born member of the first congregational church  
he is a deacon himself  queequeg is   

  young man  said bildad sternly    thou art skylarking 
with me explain thyself  thou young hittite  what 
church dost thee mean   answer me   

finding myself thus hard pushed  i replied    i mean  sir  
the same ancient catholic church to which you and i  
and captain peleg there  and queequeg here  and all of 
us  and every mother s son and soul of us belong   the 
great and everlasting first congregation of this whole 
worshipping world   we all belong to that   only some of 
us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the 
grand belief   in that we all join hands  

  splice  thou mean st splice hands  cried peleg  draw- 
ing nearer    young man  you  d better ship for a mis- 
sionary  instead of a foremast hand   i never heard a 
better sermon  deacon deuteronomy why father 
mapple himself couldn t beat it  and he  s reckoned some- 
thing  come aboard  come aboard   never mind about 
the papers  i say  tell quohog there what  s that you 
call him   tell quohog to step along  by the great 
anchor  what a harpoon he  s got there   looks like good 
stuff that   and he handles it about right  i say  quohog  



112 moby-dick 

or whatever your name is  did you ever stand in the head 
of a whale-boat   did you ever strike a fish     

without saying a word  queequeg  in his wild sort of 
way  jumped upon the bulwarks  from thence into the 
bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side   and 
then bracing his left knee  and poising his harpoon  cried 
out in some such way as this   

  cap ain  you see him small drop tar on water dere   
you see him   well  spose him one whale eye  well  den     
and taking sharp aim at it  he darted the iron right over 
old bildad s broad brim  clean across the ship s decks  
and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight  

  now  5 said queequeg  quietly hauling in the line  
  spos-ee him whale-e eye   why  dad whale dead   

  quick  bildad   said peleg to his partner  who  aghast 
at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon  had retreated 
toward the cabin gangway    quick  i say  you  bildad  
and get the ship s papers  we must have hedgehog 
there  i mean quohog  in one of our boats  look ye  
quohog  we  11 give ye the ninetieth lay  and that  s 
more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of 
nantucket   

so down we went into the cabin  and to my great joy 
queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship s 
company to which i myself belonged  

when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got 
everything ready for signing  he turned to me and said  
  i guess  quohog there don t know how to write  does he   
i say  quohog  blast ye   dost thou sign thy name or 
make thy mark     

but at this question  queequeg  who had twice or 
thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies  looked 
no ways abashed   but taking the offered pen  copied 
upon the paper  in the proper place  an exact counterpart 
of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm   



his mark 113 

so that through captain peleg s obstinate mistake touch- 
ing his appellative  it stood something like this   

quohog  
his  j  mark  

meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and stead- 
fastly eyeing queequeg  and at last rising solemnly and 
fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab 
coat  took out a bundle of tracts  and selecting one entitled 
  the latter day coming   or no time to lose   placed 
it in queequeg  s hands  and then grasping them and the 
book with both his  looked earnestly into his eyes  and 
said    son of darkness  i must do my duty by thee   i am 
part owner of this ship  and feel concerned for the souls of 
all its crew   if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways  which 
i sadly fear  i beseech thee  remain not for aye a belial 
bondsman  spurn the idol bell  and the hideous dragon   
turn from the wrath to come   mind thine eye  i say   oh   
goodness gracious   steer clear of the fiery pit     

something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s 
language  heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and 
domestic phrases  

  avast there  avast there  bildad  avast now spoiling

make good voyagers it takes the shark out of  em   no 
harpooneer is worth a straw who ain t pretty sharkish  
there was young nat swaine  once the bravest boat-

frightened about his plaguy soul  that he shrinked and 
sheered away from whales  for fear of after-claps  in case 
he got stove and went to davy jones

time   thou knowest  peleg  what it is to have the fear of

death   how  then  can st thou prate in this ungodly guise  
thou beliest thine own heart  peleg  tell me  when this 
same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that 
typhoon on japan  that same voyage when thou went 
mate with captain ahab  didst thou not think of death 
and the judgment then     

  hear him  hear him now    cried peleg  marching across 
the cabin  and thrusting his hands far down into his 
pockets    hear him  all of ye  think of that   when 
every moment we thought the ship would sink   death 
and the judgment then   what   with all three masts 
making such an everlasting thundering against the side   
and every sea breaking over us  fore and aft  think of 
death and the judgment then   no   no time to think 
about death then  life was what captain ahab and i 
was thinking of   and how to save all hands how to rig 
jury-masts how to get into the nearest port   that was 
what i was thinking of    

bildad said no more  but buttoning up his coat  stalked 
on deck  where we followed him  there he stood  very 
quietly overlooking some sail-makers who were mending 
a topsail in the waist  now and then he stooped to pick 
up a patch  or save an end of the tarred twine  which 
otherwise might have been wasted

the peophet 

  shipmates  have ye shipped in that ship     

queequeg and i had just left the pequod  and were 
sauntering away from the water  for the moment each 
occupied with his own thoughts  when the above words 
were put to us by a stranger  who  pausing before us  
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question  
he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and 
patched trowsers   a rag of a black handkerchief investing 
his neck  a confluent small-pox had in all directions 
flowed over his face  and left it like the complicated ribbed 
bed of a torrent  when the rushing waters have been 
dried up  

4 have ye shipped in her     he repeated  

4 you mean the ship pequod  i suppose   said i  trying 
to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him  

  ay  the pequod that ship there  he said  drawing 
back his whole arm  and then rapidly shoving it straight 
out from him  with the fixed bayonet of his pointed 
finger darted full at the object  

  yes   said i    we have just signed the articles   

  anything down there about your souls     

  about what     

  oh  perhaps you hav n t got any   he said quickly  
no matter though  i know many chaps that hav n t got 

ly  good luck to  em   and they are all the better off for 
it  a soul  s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon   

  what are you jabbering about  shipmate     said i  

115 

  



116 moby-dick 

  he  s got enough  though  to make up for all de- 
ficiencies of that sort in other chaps   abruptly said the 
stranger  placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he  

  queequeg   said i    let  s go   this fellow has broken 
loose from somewhere   he  s talking about something 
and somebody we don t know   

  stop     cried the stranger    ye said true ye 
hav n t seen old thunder yet  have ye     

  who  s old thunder     said i  again riveted with the 
insane earnestness of his manner  

  captain ahab   

  what   the captain of our ship  the pequod     

  ay  among some of us old sailor chaps  he goes by 
that name  ye hav n t seen him yet  have ye     

  no  we hav n t  he  s sick  they say  but is getting 
better  and will be all right again before long   

4 all right again before long     laughed the stranger  
with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh    look ye   when 
captain ahab is all right  then this left arm of mine will 
be all right   not before   

i what do you know about him     

  what did they tell you about him   say that     

  they didn t tell much of anything about him   only 
i  ve heard that he  s a good whale -hunter  and a good 
captain to his crew   

  that  s true  that  s true yes  both true enough  
but you must jump when he gives an order  step and 
growl   growl and go that  s the word with captain 
ahab  but nothing about that thing that happened to 
him off cape horn  long ago  when he lay like dead for 
three days and nights   nothing about that deadly scrim- 
mage with the spaniard afore the altar in santa   heard 
nothing about that  eh   nothing about the silver cala- 
bash he spat into   and nothing about his losing his 
leg last voyage  according to the prophecy  didn t ye 



the prophet 117 

hear a word about them matters and something more  eh   
no  i don t think ye did   how could ye   who knows 
it   not all nantucket  i guess  but hows ever  may- 
hap  ye ve heard tell about the leg  and how he lost it   
ay  ye have heard of that  i dare say  oh yes  that 
every one knows a  most i mean they know he  s only 
one leg   and that a parmacetti took the other off   

4 my friend  said i    what all this gibberish of yours is 
about  i don t know  and i don t much care   for it seems 
to me that you must be a little damaged in the head  
but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there  
the pequod  then let me tell you  that i know all about 
the loss of his leg   

  all about it  eh sure you do   all     

  pretty sure   

with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod  the 
beggar-like stranger stood a moment  as if in a troubled 
re very   then starting a little  turned and said    ye ve 
shipped  have ye   names down on the papers   well  
well  what  s signed  is signed   and what  s to be  will be   
and then again  perhaps it won t be  after all  anyhow  
it s all fixed and arranged a  ready   and some sailors 
or other must go with him  i suppose   as well these as 
any other men  god pity  em   morning to ye  shipmates  
morning   the ineffable heavens bless ye   i  m sorry i 
stopped ye   

  look here  friend   said i   if you have anything im- 
portant to tell us  out with it   but if you are only trying 
to bamboozle us  you are mistaken in your game   that  s 
all i have to say   

  and it  s said very well  and i like to hear a chap talk 
up that way   you are just the man for him the likes of 
ye  morning to ye  shipmates  morning   oh   when ye get 
there  tell  em i ve concluded not to make one of  em   

  ah  my dear fellow  you can t fool us that way you 



118 moby-dick 

can t fool us  it is the easiest thing in the world for a man 
to look as if he had a great secret in him   

  morning to ye  shipmates  morning   

  morning it is   said i    come along  queequeg  let  s 
leave this crazy man  but stop  tell me your name  will 
you   

 elijah  

elijah   thought i  and we walked away  both comment- 
ing  after each other s fashion  upon this ragged old sailor   
and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug  trying to 
be a bugbear  but we had not gone perhaps above a 
hundred yards  when chancing to turn a corner  and look- 
ing back as i did so  who should be seen but elijah follow- 
ing us  though at a distance  somehow  the sight of him 
struck me so  that i said nothing to queequeg of his being 
behind  but passed on with my comrade  anxious to see 
whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we 
did  he did   and then it seemed to me that he was 
dogging us  but with what intent i could not for the life 
of me imagine  this circumstance  coupled with his 
ambiguous  half-hinting  half-revealing  shrouded sort of 
talk  now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments 
and half -apprehensions  and all connected with the 
pequod   and captain ahab   and the leg he had lost   
and the cape horn fit   and the silver calabash   and what 
captain peleg had said of him  when i left the ship the 
day previous   and the prediction of the squaw tistig   
and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail   and a 
hundred other shadowy things  

i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah 
was really dogging us or not  and with that intent crossed 
the way with queequeg  and on that side of it retraced our 
steps  but elijah passed on  without seeming to notice 
us  this relieved me   and once more  and finally as it 
seemed to me  i pronounced him in my heart  a humbug  



chapter xx 



all astir 

a day or two passed  and there was great activity aboard 
the pequod  not only were the old sails being mended  
but new sails were coming on board  and bolts of canvas  
and coils of rigging   in short  everything betokened that 
the ship s preparations were hurrying to a close  captain 
peleg seldom or never went ashore  but sat in his wigwam 
keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands   bildad did all 
the purchasing and providing at the stores   and the men 
employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till 
long after night-fall  

on the day following queequeg s signing the articles  
word was given at all the inns where the ship s company were 
stopping  that their chests must be on board before night  
for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing  
so queequeg and i got down our traps  resolving  how- 
ever  to sleep ashore till the last  but it seems they always 
give very long notice in these cases  and the ship did not 
sail for several days  but no wonder   there was a good 
deal to be done  and there is no telling how many things 
to be thought of  before the pequod was fully equipped  

everyone knows what a multitude of things beds  
saucepans  knives and forks  shovels and tongs  napkins  
nut -crackers  and what not  are indispensable to the 
business of housekeeping  just so with whaling  which 
necessitates a three -years  housekeeping upon the wide 
ocean  far from all grocers  costermongers  doctors  bakers  
and bankers   and though this also holds true of merchant 



120 moby-dick 

vessels  yet not by any means to the same extent as with 
whalemen  for besides the great length of the whaling 
voyage  the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution 
of the fishery  and the impossibility of replacing them at 
the remote harbours usually frequented  it must be 
remembered  that of all ships  whaling-vessels are the most 
exposed to accidents of all kinds  and especially to the 
destruction and loss of the very things upon which the 
success of the voyage most depends  hence  the spare 
boats  spare spars  and spare lines and harpoons  and spare 
everythings  almost  but a spare captain and duplicate 
ship  

at the period of our arrival at the island  the heaviest 
storage of the pequod had been almost completed   com- 
prising her beef  bread  water  fuel  and iron hoops and 
staves  but  as before hinted  for some time there was a 
continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds 
and ends of things  both large and small  

chief among those who did this fetching and carrying 
was captain bildad s sister  a lean old lady of a most 
determined and indefatigable spirit  but withal very kind- 
hearted  who seemed resolved that  if she could help it  
nothing should be found wanting in the pequod  after 
once fairly getting to sea  at one time she would come 
on board with a jar of pickles for the steward s pantry   
another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate s 
desk  where he kept his log   a third time with a roll of 
flannel for the small of some one s rheumatic back  never 
did any woman better deserve her name  which was 
charity aunt charity  as everybody called her  and 
like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity 
bustle about hither and thither  ready to turn her hand 
and heart to anything that promised to yield safety  
comfort  and consolation to all on board a ship in which 
her beloved brother bildad was concerned  and in 



all astir 121 

which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved 
dollars  

but it was startling to see this excellent-hearted 
quakeress coming on board  as she did the last day  with 
a long oil-ladle in one hand  and a still longer whaling- 
lance in the other  nor was bildad himself nor captain 
peleg at all backward  as for bildad  he carried about 
with him a long list of the articles needed  and at every 
fresh arrival  down went his mark opposite that article 
upon the paper  every once and a while peleg came 
hobbling out of his whalebone den  roaring at the men 
down the hatchways  roaring up to the riggers at the 
mast-head  and then concluded by roaring back into his 
wigwam  

during these days of preparation  queequeg and i often 
visited the craft  and as often i asked about captain 
ahab  and how he was  and when he was going to come on 
board his ship  to these questions they would answer  
that he was getting better and better  and was expected 
aboard every day   meantime  the two captains  peleg 
and bildad  could attend to everything necessary to fit the 
vessel for the voyage  if i had been downright honest 
with myself  i would have seen very plainly in my heart 
that i did but half fancy being committed this way to 
so long a voyage  without once laying my eyes on the man 
who was to be the absolute dictator of it  so soon as the 
ship sailed out upon the open sea  but when a man 
suspects any wrong  it sometimes happens that if he be 
already involved in the matter  he insensibly strives to 
cover up his suspicions even from himself  and much 
this way it was with me  i said nothing  and tried to 
think nothing  

at last it was given out that some time next day the 
ship would certainly sail  so next morning  queequeg 
and i took a very early start  



chapter xxi 

going aboard 

it was nearly six o clock  but only gray imperfect misty 
dawn  when we drew nigh the wharf  

  there are some sailors running ahead there  if i see 
right  said i to queequeg    it can t be shadows   she  s off 
by sunrise  i guess   come on     

  avast     cried a voice  whose owner at the same time 
coming close behind us  laid a hand upon both our 
shoulders  and then insinuating himself between us  stood 
stooping forward a little  in the uncertain twilight  
strangely peering from queequeg to me  it was 
elijah  

c going aboard     

  hands off  will you   said i  

  lookee here   said queequeg  shaking himself    go 
 way     

  ain t going aboard  then     

  yes  we are   said i    but what business is that of 
yours   do you know  mr  elijah  that i consider you a 
little impertinent     

  no  no  no   i wasn t aware of that   said elijah  
slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg  
with the most unaccountable glances  

  elijah   said i    you will oblige my friend and me by 
withdrawing  we are going to the indian and pacific 
oceans  and would prefer not to be detained   

c ye be  be ye   coming back afore breakfast     

  he  s cracked  queequeg   said i     come on   
122 



going aboard 123 

  halloa     cried stationary elijah  hailing us when we 
had removed a few paces  

  never mind him  said i     queequeg  come on  5 

but he stole up to us again  and suddenly clapping his 
hand on my shoulder  said    did ye see anything looking 
like men going toward that ship a while ago     

struck by this plain matter-of-fact question  i answered  
saying    yes  i thought i did see four or five men   but it 
was too dim to be sure   

  very dim  very dim   said elijah    morning to ye   

once more we quitted him   but once more he came 
softly after us   and touching my shoulder again  said  
4 see if you can find  em now  will ye     

  find who     

  morning to ye   morning to ye     he rejoined  again 
moving off    oh   i was going to warn ye against 
but never mind  never mind it  s all one  all in the 
family too   sharp frost this morning  ain t it   good- 
bye to ye  shan t see ye again very soon  i guess   unless 
it  s before the grand jury   and with these cracked 
words he finally departed  leaving me  for the moment  in 
no small wonderment at his frantic impudence  

at last  stepping on board the peqiiod  we found every- 
thing in profound quiet  not a soul moving  the cabin 
entrance was locked within   the hatches were all on  and 
lumbered with coils of rigging  going forward to the 
forecastle  we found the slide of the scuttle open  seeing 
a light  we went down  and found only an old rigger there  
wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket  he was thrown at 
whole length upon two chests  his face downward and 
enclosed in his folded arms  the profoundest slumber 
slept upon him  

  those sailors we saw  queequeg  where can they have 
gone to     said i  looking dubiously at the sleeper  but 
it seemed that  when on the wharf  queequeg had not at 



124 moby-dick 

all noticed what i now alluded to   hence i would have 
thought myself to have been optically deceived in that 
matter  were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable 
question  but i beat the thing down   and again mark- 
ing the sleeper  jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps 
we had best sit up with the body   telling him to estab- 
lish himself accordingly  he put his hand upon the 
sleeper s rear  as though feeling if it was soft enough   and 
then  without more ado  sat quietly down there  

  gracious   queequeg  don t sit there   said i  

c oh   perry dood seat   said queequeg    my country 
way   won t hurt him face   

  face     said i    call that his face   very benevolent 
countenance then   but how hard he breathes  he   s 
heaving himself   get off  queequeg  you are heavy  it  s 
grinding the face of the poor  get off  queequeg   look  
he  11 twitch you off soon  i wonder he don t wake   

queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of 
the sleeper  and lighted his tomahawk-pipe  i sat at the 
feet  we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper  from 
one to the other  meanwhile  upon questioning him in 
his broken fashion  queequeg gave me to understand 
that  in his land  owing to the absence of settees and sofas 
of all sorts  the king  chiefs  and great people generally  
were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders 
for ottomans   and to furnish a house comfortably in that 
respect  you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows  
and lay them round in the piers and alcoves  besides  
it was very convenient on an excursion   much better 
than those garden-chairs which are convertible into 
walking-sticks   upon occasion  a chief calling his attend- 
ant  and desiring him to make a settee of himself 
under a spreading tree  perhaps in some damp marshy 
place  

while narrating these things  every time queequeg 



going aboard 125 

received the tomahawk from me  he flourished the hatchet - 
side of it over the sleeper s head  

  what  s that for  queequeg     

  perry easy  kill-e   oh   perry easy     

he was going on with some wild reminiscences about 
his tomahawk-pipe  which  it seemed  had in its two uses 
both brained his foes and soothed his soul  when we were 
directly attracted to the sleeping rigger  the strong 
vapour now completely filling the contracted hole  it began 
to tell upon him  he breathed with a sort of muffledness   
then seemed troubled in the nose   then revolved over 
once or twice   then sat up and rubbed his eyes  

4 halloa     he breathed at last    who be ye smokers     

  shipped men  answered i  c when does she sail     

  ay  ay  ye are going in her  be ye   she sails to- 
day  the captain came aboard last night   

  what captain   ahab     

  who but him indeed     

i was going to ask him some further questions concern- 
ing ahab  when we heard a noise on deck  

  halloa   starbuck  s astir   said the rigger    he  s 
a lively chief mate  that    good man  and a pious   but 
all alive now  i must turn to   and so saying he went on 
deck  and we followed  

it was now clear sunrise  soon the crew came on board 
in twos and threes   the riggers bestirred themselves   the 
mates were actively engaged   and several of the shore 
people were busy in bringing various last things on board  
meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined 
within his cabin  



chapter xxii 

merry christmas 

at length  toward noon  upon the final dismissal of the 
ship s riggers  and after the pequod had been hauled out 
from the wharf  and after the ever-thoughtful charity 
had come off in a whale-boat  with her last gift a night- 
cap for stubb  the second mate  her brother-in-law  and 
a spare bible for the steward after all this  the two 
captains  peleg and bildad  issued from the cabin  and 
turning to the chief mate  peleg said   

  now  mr  starbuck  are you sure everything is right   
captain ahab is all ready just spoke to him nothing 
more to be got from shore  eh   well  call all hands  
then  muster  em aft here blast  em     

  no need of profane words  however great the hurry  
peleg   said bildad    but away with thee  friend starbuck  
and do our bidding   

how now   here upon the very point of starting for 
the voyage  captain peleg and captain bildad were going 
it with a high hand on the quarter-deck  just as if they 
were to be joint-commanders at sea  as well as to all 
appearances in port  and  as for captain ahab  no sign 
of him was yet to be seen   only  they said he was in the 
cabin  but then  the idea was  that his presence was by 
no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh  and 
steering her well out to sea  indeed  as that was not at 
all his proper business  but the pilot s   and as he was not 
yet completely recovered so they said therefore  cap- 
tain ahab stayed below  and all this seemed natural 

126 



mekry christmas 127 

enough   especially as in the merchant service many 
captains never show themselves on deck for a consider- 
able time after heaving up the anchor  but remain over 
the cabin table  having a farewell merry-making with 
their shore friends  before they quit the ship for good 
with the pilot  

but there was not much chance to think over the 
matter  for captain peleg was now all alive  he seemed to 
do most of the talking and commanding  and not bildad  

  aft here  ye sons of bachelors   he cried  as the sailors 
lingered at the mainmast    mr  starbuck  drive  em 
aft   

  strike the tent there     was the next order  as i 
hinted before  this whalebone marquee was never pitched 
except in port   and on board the pequod  for thirty years  
the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next 
thing to heaving up the anchor  

  man the capstan   blood and thunder   jump     
was the next command  and the crew sprang for the 
handspikes  

now  in getting under weigh  the station generally 
occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship  
and here bildad  who  with peleg  be it known  in addi- 
tion to his other offices  was one of the licensed pilots of 
the port he being suspected to have got himself made a 
pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot -fee to all the 
ships he was concerned in  for he never piloted any other 
craft bildad  i say  might now be seen actively engaged 
in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor  
and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of 
psalmody  to cheer the hands at the windlass  who roared 
forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley  
with hearty goodwill  nevertheless  not three days 
previous  bildad had told them that no profane songs 
would be allowed on board the pequod  particularly in 




128 moby-dick 

getting under weigh   and charity  his sister  had placed 
a small choice copy of watts in each seaman s berth  

meantime  overseeing the other part of the ship  captain 
peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful 
manner  i almost thought he would sink the ship before 
the anchor could be got up   involuntarily i paused on my 
handspike  and told queequeg to do the same  thinking 
of the perils we both ran  in starting on the voyage with 
such a devil for a pilot  i was comforting myself  how- 
ever  with the thought that in pious bildad might be 
found some salvation  spite of his seven hundred and 
seventy-seventh lay   when i felt a sudden sharp poke 
in my rear  and turning round  was horrified at the 
apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing 
his leg from my immediate vicinity  that was my first 
kick  

  is that the way they heave in the marchant service     
he roared    spring  thou sheep-head   spring  and break 
thy backbone   why don t ye spring  i say  all of ye 
spring   quohag   spring  thou chap with the red 
whiskers   spring there  scotch-cap   spring  thou green 
pants  spring  i say  all of ye  and spring your eyes out     
and so saying  he moved along the windlass  here and 
there using his leg very freely  while imperturbable bildad 
kept leading off with his psalmody  thinks i  captain 
peleg must have been drinking something to-day  

at last the anchor was up  the sails were set  and off 
we glided  it was a short  cold christmas   and as the 
short northern day merged into night  we found ourselves 
almost broad upon the wintry ocean  whose freezing spray 
cased us in ice  as in polished armour  the long rows of 
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight   and 
like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant  vast 
curving icicles depended from the bows  

lank bildad  as pilot  headed the first watch  and ever 



merry christmas 129 

and anon  as the old craft deep dived into the green seas  
and sent the shivering frost all over her  and the winds 
howled  and the cordage rang  his steady notes were 
heard  

  sweet fields beyond the swelling flood  

stand dressed in living green  

so to the jews old canaan stood  

while jordan rolled between   

never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me 
than then  they were full of hope and fruition  spite 
of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic  
spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket  there was yet  it 
then seemed to me  many a pleasant haven in store   and 
meads and glades so eternally vernal  that the grass shot 
up by the spring  untrodden  unwilted  remains at 
midsummer  

at last we gained such an offing  that the two pilots 
were needed no longer  the stout sail-boat that had 
accompanied us began ranging alongside  

it was curious and not unpleasing  how peleg and bildad 
were affected at this juncture  especially captain bildad  
for loath to depart  yet   very loath to leave  for good  
a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage beyond 
both stormy capes   a ship in which some thousands of 
his hard-earned dollars were invested   a ship  in which 
an old shipmate sailed as captain   a man almost as old 
as he  once more starting to encounter all the terrors of 
the pitiless jaw   loath to say good-bye to a thing so every 
way brimful of every interest to him  poor old bildad 
lingered long   paced the deck with anxious strides   ran 
down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there   
again came on deck  and looked to windward   looked 
toward the wide and endless waters  only bounded by the 
  r-off unseen eastern continents   looked toward the

land   looked aloft   looked right and left   looked every- 
where and nowhere   and at last  mechanically coiling 
a rope upon its pin  convulsively grasped stout peleg 
by the hand  and holding up a lantern  for a moment stood 
gazing heroically in his face  as much as to say    never- 
theless  friend peleg  i can stand it   yes  i can   

as for peleg himself  he took it more like a philosopher   
but for all his philosophy  there was a tear twinkling in 
his eye  when the lantern came too near  and he  too  
did not a little run from cabin to deck now a word 
below  and now a word with starbuck  the chief mate  

but  at last  he turned to his comrade  with a final sort 
of look about him  4 captain bildad come  old ship- 
mate  we must go  back the main-yard there   boat 
ahoy   stand by to come close alongside  now   careful  
careful   come  bildad  boy say your last  luck to ye

murmured old bildad  almost incoherently    i hope 
ye  11 have fine weather now  so that captain ahab may 
soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he needs  
and ye  11 have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go  
be careful in the hunt  ye mates  don t stave the boats

don t waste the spare staves  oh   the sail-needles are 
in the green locker   don t whale it too much a lord s 
days  men   but don t miss a fair chance either  that  s 
rejecting heaven s good gifts  have an eye to the

away     and with that  peleg hurried him over the side  
and both dropped into the boat  

ship and boat diverged   the cold  damp night breeze 
blew between   a screaming gull flew overhead   the two 
hulls wildly rolled   we gave three heavy-hearted cheers  
and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic

the lee shore 

some chapters back  one bulkington was spoken of  a tall  
new-landed mariner  encountered in new bedford at the 
inn  

when on that shivering winter s night the pequod 
thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves  
who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington   
i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the 
man  who in mid- winter just landed from a four years  
dangerous voyage  could so unrestingly push off again 
for still another tempestuous term  the land seemed 
scorching to his feet  wonderfullest things are ever the 
unmentionable   deep memories yield no epitaphs   this 
six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington  let 
me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed 
ship  that miserably drives along the leeward land  the 
port would fain give succour   the port is pitiful   in the 
port is safety  comfort  hearthstone  supper  warm 
blankets  friends  all that  s kind to our mortalities  but 
in that gale  the port  the land  is that ship s direst 
jeopardy   she must fly all hospitality   one touch of land  
though it but graze the keel  would make her shudder 
through and through  with all her might she crowds all 
sail off shore   in so doing  fights  gainst the very winds 
that fain would blow her homeward   seeks all the lashed 
sea s landlessness again   for refuge s sake forlornly 
rushing into peril   her only friend her bitterest foe   

know ye  now  bulkington   glimpses do ye seem to 

132 



the lee shore 133 

see of that mortally intolerable truth   that all deep  
earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to 
keep the open independence of her sea   while the wildest 
winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the 
treacherous  slavish shore   

but as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth  
shoreless  indefinite as god so  better is it to perish in 
that howling infinite  than be ingloriously dashed upon 
the lee  even if that were safety   for worm-like  then  
oh   who would craven crawl to land   terrors of the 
terrible   is all this agony so vain   take heart  take 
heart  bulkington   bear thee grimly  demigod   up 
from the spray of thy ocean-perishing straight up  
leaps thy apotheosis   



chapter xxiv 

the advocate 

as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this busi- 
ness of whaling   and as this business of whaling has some- 
how come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather 
unpoetical and disreputable pursuit   therefore  i am all 
anxiety to convince ye  ye landsmen  of the injustice 
hereby done to us hunters of whales  

in the first place  it may be deemed almost superfluous 
to establish the fact  that among people at large  the 
business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what 
are called the liberal professions  if a stranger were 
introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society  
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his 
merits  were he presented to the company as a harpooneer  
say   and if in emulation of the naval officers he should 
append the initials s w f   sperm whale fishery  to 
his visiting card  such a procedure would be deemed pre- 
eminently presuming and ridiculous  

doubtless one leading reason why the world declines 
honouring us whalemen is this   they think that  at best  
our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business   
and that when actively engaged therein  we are surrounded 
by all manner of defilements  butchers we are  that is 
true  but butchers  also  and butchers of the bloodiest 
badge  have been all martial commanders whom the world 
invariably delights to honour  and as for the matter of 
the alleged uncleanliness of our business  ye shall soon 
be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally

unknown  and which  upon the whole  will triumphantly 
plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest 
things of this tidy earth  but even granting the charge 
in question to be true   what disordered slippery decks 
of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion 
of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return 
to drink in all ladies  plaudits   and if the idea of peril 
so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier s 
profession   let me assure ye that many a veteran who 
has freely marched up to a battery  would quickly recoil 
at the apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail  fanning 
into eddies the air over his head  for what are the 
comprehensible terrors of man compared with the inter- i 
linked terrors and wonders of god   

but  though the world scouts at us whale-hunters  yet 
does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage   yea  
an all-abounding adoration   for almost all the tapers  
lamps  and candles that burn round the globe  burn  
as before so many shrines  to our glory   

but look at this matter in other lights   weigh it in all 
sorts of scales   see what we whalemen are  and have been  

why did the dutch in de witt s time have admirals 
of their whaling-fleets   why did louis xvi  of france  
at his own personal expense  fit out whaling-ships from 
dunkirk  and politely invite to that town some score or 
two of families from our own island of nantucket   why 
did britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her 
whalemen in bounties upward of 1 000 000   and 
lastly  how comes it that we whalemen of america now  
outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen hi the   
world   sail a navy of upward of seven hundred vessels   
manned by eighteen thousand men   yearly consuming 
4 000 000 of dollars   the ships worth  at the time of 
sailing   20 000 000   and every year importing into our 
harbours a well-reaped harvest of  7 000 000  how 



136 moby-dick 

comes all this  if there be not something puissant in 
whaling   

but this is not the half   look again  
i freely assert  that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot  
for his life  point out one single peaceful influence  which 
within the last sixty years has operated more potentially 
upon the whole broad world  taken in one aggregate  than 
the high and mighty business of whaling  one way and 
another  it has begotten events so remarkable in them- 
selves  and so continuously momentous in their sequential 
f issues  that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian 
  mother  who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her 
womb  it would be a hopeless  endless task to catalogue 
all these things  let a handful suffice  for many years 
  past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out 
the remotest and least known parts of the earth  she has 
explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart  
where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed  if ameri- 
can and european men-of-war now peacefully ride in once 
savage harbours  let them fire salutes to the honour and 
the glory of the whale-ship  which originally showed them 
the way  and first interpreted between them and the 
savages  they may celebrate as they will the heroes 
of exploring expeditions  your cooks  your krusen- 
sterns   but i say that scores of anonymous captains 
have sailed out of nantucket  that were as great  and 
greater than your cook and your krusenstern  for in 
their succourless empty-handedness  they  in the heathen- 
ish sharked waters  and by the beaches of unrecorded  
javelin islands  battled with virgin wonders and terrors 
that cook with all his marines and muskets would not 
willingly have dared  all that is made such a flourish of 
in the old south sea voyages  those things were but the 
lifetime commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers  
often  adventures which vancouver dedicates three

down in the ship s common log  ah  the world   oh

until the whale-fishery rounded cape horn  no com- 
merce but colonial  scarcely any intercourse but colonial  
was carried on between europe and the long line of the 
opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast  it was 
the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy 
of the spanish crown  touching those colonies   and  if 
space permitted  it might be distinctly shown how from 
those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru  
chili  and bolivia from the yoke of old spain  and the 
establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts  

that great america on the other side of the sphere  
australia  was given to the enlightened world by the 
whaleman  after its first blunder-born discovery by a 
dutchman  all other ships long shunned those shores as 
pestiferously barbarous   but the whale -ship touched 
there  the whale-ship is the true mother of that now 
mighty colony  moreover  in the infancy of the first 
australian settlement  the emigrants were several times 
saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the 
whale -ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters  
the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same 
truth  and do commercial homage to the whale-ship  that 
cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant  and 
in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their 
first destinations  if that double -bolted land  japan  
is ever to become hospitable  it is the whale-ship alone 
to whom the credit will be due   for already she is on the 
threshold  

but if  in the face of all this  you still declare that 
whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected 
with it  then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you 

jre  and unhorse you with a split helmet every time

the whale has no famous author  and whaling no

the whale no famous author  and whaling no famous

postscript 

in behalf of the dignity of whaling  i would fain advance 
naught but substantiated facts  but after embattling his 
facts  an advocate who should wholly suppress a not 
unreasonable surmise  which might tell eloquently upon his 
cause such an advocate  would he not be blameworthy   

it is well known that at the coronation of kings and 
queens  even modern ones  a certain curious process of 
seasoning them for their functions is gone through  there 
is a salt-cellar of state  so called  and there may be a castor 
of state  how they use the salt  precisely who knows   
certain i am  however  that a king s head is solemnly 
oiled at his coronation  even as a head of salad  can it 
be  though  that they anoint it with a view of making 
its interior run well  as they anoint machinery   much 
might be ruminated here  concerning the essential dignity 
of this regal process  because in common life we esteem 
but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his 
hair  and palpably smells of that anointing  in truth  a 
mature man who uses hair-oil  unless medicinally  that 
man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere  
as a general rule  he can t amount to much in his totality  

but the only thing to be considered here  is this what 
kind of oil is used at coronations   certainly it cannot 
be olive oil  nor macassar oil  nor castor oil  nor bear s oil  
nor train oil  nor cod-liver oil  what then can it possibly 
be  but sperm oil in its unmanufactured  unpolluted 
state  the sweetest of all oils   

think of that  ye loyal britons   we whalemen supply 
your kings and queens with coronation stuff

the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck  a native of 
nantucket  and a quaker by descent  he was a long  
earnest man  and though born on an icy coast  seemed 
well adapted to endure hot latitudes  his flesh being hard 
as twice-baked biscuit  transported to the indies  his 
live blood would not spoil like bottled ale  he must have 
been born in some time of general drought and famine  
or upon one of those fast days for which his state is 
famous  only some thirty arid summers had he seen   
those summers had dried up all his physical superfluous- 
ness  but this  his thinness  so to speak  seemed no more 
the token of wasting anxieties and cares  than it seemed 
the indication of any bodily blight  it was merely the 
condensation of the man  he was by no means ill-look- 
ing   quite the contrary  his pure tight skin was an 
excellent fit   and closely wrapped up in it  and embalmed 
with inner health and strength  like a revivified egyptian  
this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages 
to come  and to endure always  as now   for be it polar 
snow or torrid sun  like a patent chronometer  his interior 
vitality was warranted to do well in all climates  look- 
ing into his eyes  you seemed to see there the yet lingering 
images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly con- 
fronted through life  a staid  steadfast man  whose life 
for the most part was a telling pantomime of action  and 
not a tame chapter of sounds  yet  for all his hardy 
 briety and fortitude  there were certain qualities in 

141

him which at times affected  and in some cases seemed well- 
nigh to overbalance all the rest  uncommonly con- 
scientious for a seaman  and endued with a deep natural 
reverence  the wild watery loneliness of his life did there- 
fore strongly incline him to superstition   but to that 
sort of superstition  which in some organisations seems 
rather to spring  somehow  from intelligence than from 
ignorance  outward portents and inward presentiments 
were his  and if at times these things bent the welded 
iron of his soul  much more did his far-away domestic 
memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend 
him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature  
and open him still further to those latent influences which  
in some honest-hearted men  restrain the gush of dare- 
devil daring  so often evinced by others in the more 
perilous vicissitudes of the fishery    i will have no man 
in my boat  said starbuck    who is not afraid of a whale   
by this  he seemed to mean  not only that the most 
reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the 
fair estimation of the encountered peril  but that an 
utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than 
a coward  

  ay  ay  said stubb  the second mate    starbuck  
there  is as careful a man as you  11 find anywhere in this 
fishery   but we shall ere long see what that word 
  careful   precisely means when used by a man like stubb  
or almost any other whale-hunter  

starbuck was no crusader after perils   in him courage 
was not a sentiment   but a thing simply useful to him  
and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions  
besides  he thought  perhaps  that hi this business of 
whaling  courage was one of the great staple outfits of the 
ship  like her beef and her bread  and not to be foolishly 
wasted  wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for 
whales after sundown   nor for persisting in fighting a 



knights and squires 143 

fish that too much persisted in fighting him  for  thought 
starbuck  i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales 
for my living  and not to be killed by them for theirs   
and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck 
well knew  what doom was his own father s   where  
in the bottomless deeps  could he find the torn limbs of 
his brother   

with memories like these in him  and  moreover  given 
to a certain superstitiousness  as has been said   the 
courage of this starbuck which could  nevertheless  still 
flourish  must indeed have been extreme  but it was not 
in reasonable nature that a man so organised  and with 
such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had   
it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently 
engendering an element in him  which  under suitable 
circumstances  would break out from its confinement  
and burn all his courage up  and brave as he might be  
it was that sort of bravery chiefly  visible in some intrepid 
men  which  while generally abiding firm in the conflict 
with seas  or winds  or whales  or any of the ordinary 
irrational horrors of the world  yet cannot withstand 
those more terrific  because more spiritual terrors  which 
sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an 
enraged and mighty man  

but were the coming narrative to reveal  in any instance  
the complete abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude  
scarce might i have the heart to write it   for it is a thing 
most sorrowful  nay shocking  to expose the fall of valour 
in the soul  men may seem detestable as joint-stock 
companies and nations   knaves  fools  and murderers 
there may be   men may have mean and meagre aces   
but man  hi the ideal  is so noble and so sparkling  such 
a grand and glowing creature  that over any ignominious 
blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their 
costliest robes  that immaculate manliness we feel 



144 moby-dick 

within ourselves  so far within us  that it remains intact 
though all the outer character seem gone  bleeds with 
keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valour- 
ruined man  nor can piety itself  at such a shameful 
sight  completely stifle her upbraidings against the per- 
mitting stars  but this august dignity i treat of  is not 
the dignity of kings and robes  but that abounding dignity 
which has no robed investiture  thou shalt see it shining 
in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike   that 
democratic dignity which  on all hands  radiates without 
end from god   himself   the great god absolute   
the centre and circumference of all democracy   his 
omnipresence  our divine equality   

if  then  to meanest mariners  and renegades and casta- 
ways  i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities  though dark   
weave round them tragic graces   if even the most mourn- 
ful  perchance the most abased  among them all  shall at 
times lift himself to the exalted mounts   if i shall touch 
that workman s arm with some ethereal light   if i shall 
spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun   then 
against all mortal critics bear me out in it  thou just 
spirit of equality  which hast spread one royal mantle 
of humanity over all my kind   bear me out in it  thou 
great democratic god   who didst not refuse to the 
swart convict  bunyan  the pale  poetic pearl   thou 
who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest 
gold  the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes   
thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles   
who didst hurl him upon a war-horse   who didst thunder 
him higher than a throne   thou who  in all thy mighty  
earthly marchings  ever cullest thy selectest champions 
from the kingly commons   bear me out in it  god

stubb was the second mate  he was a native of cape 
cod   and hence  according to local usage  was called a 
cape-cod-man  a happy-go-lucky   neither craven nor 
valiant   taking perils as they came with an indifferent 
air   and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of 
the chase  toiling away  calm and collected as a journey- 
man joiner engaged for the year  good-humoured  easy  
and careless  he presided over his whale-boat as if the 
most deadly encounter were but a dinner  and his crew 
all invited guests  he was as particular about the com- 
fortable arrangement of his part of the boat  as an old 
stage-driver is about the snugness of his box  when close 
to the whale  in the very death-lock of the fight  he 
handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly  
as a whistling tinker his hammer  he would hum over 
his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most 
exasperated monster  long usage had  for this stubb  
converted the jaws of death into an easy-chair  what 
he thought of death itself  there is no telling  whether 
he ever thought of it at all  might be a question   but  if 
he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a com- 
fortable dinner  no doubt  like a good sailor  he took it to 
be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft  and bestir 
themselves there  about something which he would find 
out when he obeyed the order  and not sooner  

what  perhaps  with other things  made stubb such an 
easy-going  unfearing man  so cheerily trudging off with

the burden of life in a world full of grave peddlers  all 
bowed to the ground with their packs   what helped to 
bring about that almost impious good-humour of his   
that thing must have been his pipe  for  like his nose  
his short  black little pipe was one of the regular features 
of his face  you would almost as soon have expected 
him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without 
his pipe  he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded  
stuck in a rack  within easy reach of his hand   and  
whenever he turned in  he smoked them all out in suc- 
cession  lighting one from the other to the end of the 
chapter   then loading them again to be in readiness anew  
for  when stubb dressed  instead of first putting his legs 
into his trowsers  he put his pipe into his mouth  

i say this continual smoking must have been one 
cause  at least  of his peculiar disposition   for everyone 
knows that this earthly air  whether ashore or afloat  is 
terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the number- 
less mortals who have died exhaling it   and as in time 
of the cholera  some people go about with a camphorated 
handkerchief to their mouths   so  likewise  against all 
mortal tribulations  stubb  s tobacco smoke might have 
operated as a sort of disinfecting agent  

the third mate was flask  a native of tisbury  in 
martha s vineyard  a short  stout  ruddy young fellow  
very pugnacious concerning whales  who somehow seemed 
to think that the great leviathans had personally and 
hereditarily affronted him   and therefore it was a sort 
of point of honour with him  to destroy them whenever 
encountered  so utterly lost was he to all sense of 
reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk 
and mystic ways   and so dead to anything like an appre- 
hension of any possible danger from encountering them   
that in his poor opinion  the wondrous whale was but a 
species of magnified mouse  or at least water-rat  requiring 



knights and squires 147 

only a little circumvention and some small application 
of time and trouble in order to kill and boil  this ignor- 
ant  unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little 
waggish in the matter of whales   he followed these fish 
for the fun of it   and a three years  voyage round cape 
horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time  
as a carpenter s nails are divided into wrought nails and 
cut nails   so mankind may be similarly divided  little 
flask was one of the wrought ones   made to clinch tight 
and last long  they called him king-post on board of the 
pequod   because  in form  he could be well likened to the 
short  square timber known by that name in arctic 
whalers   and which by the means of many radiating 
side timbers inserted into it  served to brace the ship 
against the icy concussions of those battering seas  

now these three mates starbuck  stubb  and flask 
were momentous men  they it was who by universal 
prescription commanded three of the pequod    boats as   
headsmen  in that grand order of battle in which gap- 
tain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend 
on the whales  these three headsmen were as captains 
of companies  or  being armed with their long keen 
whaling-spears  they were as a picked trio of lancers   
even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins  

and since in this famous fishery  each mate or heads- 
man  like a gothic knight of old  is always accompanied 
by his boat-steerer or harpooneer  who in certain con- 
junctures provides him with a fresh lance  when the former 
one has been badly twisted  or elbowed in the assault   
and moreover  as there generally subsists between the 
two a close intimacy and friendliness   it is therefore 
but meet  that in this place we set down who the pequod  s 
harpooneers were  and to what headsman each of them 
belonged  

first of all was queequeg  whom starbuck  the chief 



148 moby-dick 

mate  had selected for his squire  but queequeg is 
already known  

next was tashtego  an unmixed indian from gay 
head  the most westerly promontory of martha s vine- 
yard  where there still exists the last remnant of a village 
of red men  which has long supplied the neighbouring 
island of nantucket with many of her most daring har- 
pooneers  in the fishery  they usually go by the generic 
name of gay-headers  tashtego  s long  lean  sable hair  
his high cheek-bones  and black rounding eyes for an 
indian  oriental in their largeness  but antarctic in their 
glittering expression all this sufficiently proclaimed him 
an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior 
hunters  who  in quest of the great new england moose  
had scoured  bow in hand  the aboriginal forests of the 
main  but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild 
beasts of the woodland  tashtego now hunted in the wake 
of the great whales of the sea   the unerring harpoon of 
the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires  
to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs  you 
would almost have credited the superstitions of some of 
the earlier puritans  and half-believed this wild indian 
to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air  tash- 
tego was stubb the second mate s squire  

third among the harpooneers was daggoo  a gigantic  
coal - black negro-savage  with a lion -like tread an 
ahasuerus to behold  suspended from his ears were 
two golden hoops  so large that the sailors called them 
ring-bolts  and would talk of securing the topsail halyards 
to them  in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped 
on board of a whaler  lying in a lonely bay on his native 
coast  and never having been anywhere in the world 
but in africa  nantucket  and the pagan harbours most 
frequented by whalemen   and having now led for many 
years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners un-

knights and squires 149 

commonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped   
daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues  and erect as a 
giraffe  moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet 
five in his socks  there was a corporeal humility in 
looking up at him   and a white man standing before him 
seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress  
curious to tell  this imperial negro  ahasuerus daggoo  
was the squire of little flask  who looked like a chess-man 
beside him  as for the residue of the pequod b company  
be it said  that at the present day not one in two of the 
many thousand men before the mast employed in the 
american whale-fishery are americans born  though pretty 
nearly all the officers are  herein it is the same with 
the american whale-fishery as with the american army 
and military and merchant navies  and the engineering 
forces employed in the construction of the american 
canals and railroads  the same  i say  because in all 
these cases the native american liberally provides the 
brains  the rest of the world as generously supplying the 
muscles  no small number of these whaling seamen 
belong to the azores  where the outward-bound nan- 
tucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews 
from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores  in like 
manner  the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or 
london put in at the shetland islands  to receive the 
full complement of their crew  upon the passage home- 
ward  they drop them there again  how it is  there is 
no telling  but islanders seem to make the best whalemen  
they were nearly all islanders in the pequod    isolatoes   
too  i call such  not acknowledging the common continent 
of men  but each isolate living on a separate continent 
of his own  yet now  federated along one keel  what a 
set these isolatoes were   an anacharsis clootz deputa- 
tion from all the isles of the sea  and all the ends of the 
earth  accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the

world s grievances before that bar from which not very 
many of them ever come back  black little pip he 
never did oh  no   he went before  poor alabama boy   
on the grim pequod s forecastle  ye shall ere long see him  
beating his tambourine   prelusive of the eternal time  
when sent for  to the great quarter-deck on high  he was 
bid strike in with angels  and beat his tambourine in 
glory   called a coward here  hailed a hero there

ahab 

fob several days after leaving nantucket  nothing above 
hatches was seen of captain ahab  the mates regularly 
relieved each other at the watches  and for aught that 
could be seen to the contrary  they seemed to be the only 
commanders of the ship   only they sometimes issued from 
the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory  that 
after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously  
yes  their supreme lord and dictator was there  though 
hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate 
into the now sacred retreat of the cabin  

every time i ascended to the deck from my watches 
below  i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face 
were visible   for my first vague disquietude touching 
the unknown captain  now in the seclusion of the sea  
became almost a perturbation  this was strangely 
heightened at times by the ragged elijah s diabolical 
incoherences uninvitingly recurring to me  with a subtle 
energy i could not have before conceived of  but poorly 
could i withstand them  much as in other moods i was 
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that 
outlandish prophet of the wharves  but whatever it was 
of apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call it so which i 
felt  yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship  
it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions  
for though the harpooneers  with the great body of the 
crew  were a far more barbaric  heathenish  and motley 
set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which 

151 



152 moby-dick 

my previous experiences had made me acquainted with  
still i ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the fierce 
uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian 
vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked  but 
it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of 
the ship  the mates  which was most forcibly calculated 
to allay these colourless misgivings  and induce confidence 
and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage  
three better  more likely sea-officers and men  each in 
his own different way  could not readily be found  and 
they were every one of them americans   a nantucketer  
a vineyarder  a cape man  now  it being christmas 
when the ship shot from out her harbour  for a space we 
had biting polar weather  though all the time running 
away from it to the southward   and by every degree 
and minute of latitude which we sailed  gradually leaving 
that merciless winter  and all its intolerable weather 
behind us  it was one of those less lowering  but still 
gray and gloomy enough mornings of the transition  when 
with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water 
with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity  
that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon 
watch  so soon as i levelled my glance toward the tanrail  
foreboding shivers ran over me  reality outran appre- 
hension    captain ahab stood upon his quarter-deck  

there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about 
him  nor of the recovery from any  he looked like a man 
cut away from the stake  when the fire has overrunningly 
wasted all the limbs without consuming them  or taking 
away one particle from their compacted aged robustness  
his whole high  broad form  seemed made of solid bronze  
and shaped in an unalterable mould  like cellini s cast 
perseus  threading its way out from among his gray 
hairs  and continuing right down one side of his tawny 
scorched face and neck  till it disappeared in his clothing  






ahab 153 

you saw a slender rod-like mark  lividly whitish  it 
resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in 
the straight  lofty trunk of a great tree  when the upper 
lightning tearingly darts down it  and without wrenching 
a single twig  peels and grooves out the bark from top to 
bottom  ere running off into the soil  leaving the tree still 
greenly alive  but branded  whether that mark was born 
with him  or whether it was the scar left by some desperate 
wound  no one could certainly say  by some tacit con- 
sent  throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made 
to it  especially by the mates  but once tashtego s 
senior  an old gay-head indian among the crew  super- 
stitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years 
old did ahab become that way branded  and then it 
came upon him  not in the fury of any mortal fray  but 
in an elemental strife at sea  yet  this wild hint seemed 
inferentially negatived by what a gray manxman in- 
sinuated  an old sepulchral man  who  having never 
before sailed out of nantucket  had never ere this laid eye 
upon wild ahab  nevertheless  the old sea-traditions  
the immemorial credulities  popularly invested this old 
manxman with preternatural powers of discernment  
so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when 
he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly 
laid out which might hardly come to pass  so he muttered 
then  whoever should do that last office for the dead 
would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole  

so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect 
me  and the livid brand which streaked it  that for the 
first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this 
overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white 
leg upon which he partly stood  it had previously come 
to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from 
the polished bone of the sperm whale s jaw    ay  he 
was dismasted off japan   said the old gay-head indian 



154 moby-dick 

once     but like his dismasted craft  he shipped another 
mast without coming home for it  he has a quiver of  em   

i was struck with the singular posture he maintained  
upon each side of the pequod s quarter-deck  and pretty 
close to the mizen shrouds  there was an auger-hole  
bored about half an inch or so  into the plank  his bone 
leg steadied in that hole   one arm elevated  and holding 
by a shroud   captain ahab stood erect  looking straight 
out beyond the ship s ever-pitching prow  there was an 
infinity of firmest fortitude  a determinate  unsurrender- 
able wilfulness  in the fixed and fearless  forward dedi- 
cation of that glance  not a word he spoke   nor did 
his officers say aught to him   though by all their minutest 
gestures and expressions  they plainly showed the uneasy  
if not painful  consciousness of being under a troubled 
master-eye  and not only that  but moody stricken 
ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face   
in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some 
mighty woe  

ere long  from his first visit in the air  he withdrew into 
his cabin  but after that morning  he was every day 
visible to the crew   either standing in his pivot -hole  
or seated upon an ivory stool he had   or heavily walking 
the deck  as the sky grew less gloomy   indeed  began 
to grow a little genial  he became still less and less a recluse   
as if  when the ship had sailed from home  nothing but 
the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him 
so secluded  and  by and by  it came to pass  that he 
was almost continually in the air   but  as yet  for all that 
he said  or perceptibly did  on the at last sunny deck  he 
seemed as unnecessary there as another mast  but the 
pequod was only making a passage now   not regularly 
cruising   nearly all whaling preparatives needing super- 
vision the mates were fully competent to  so that there 
was little or nothing  out of himself  to employ or excite 



ahab 155 

ahab now   and thus chase away  for that one interval  
the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his 
brow  as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile 
themselves upon  

nevertheless  ere long  the warm  warbling persuasive- 
ness of the pleasant  holiday weather we came to  seemed 
gradually to charm him from his mood  for  as when the 
red-cheeked  dancing girls  april and may  trip home to 
the wintry  misanthropic woods   even the barest  
ruggedest  most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send 
forth some few green sprouts  to welcome such glad- 
hearted visitants   so ahab did  in the end  a little 
respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air  more 
than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look  
which  in any other man  would have soon flowered out 
in a smile  






chapter xxix 

to him  stubb 

some days elapsed  and ice and icebergs all astern  the 
pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring  
which  at sea  almost perpetually reigns on the threshold 
of the eternal august of the tropic  the warmly cool  
clear  ringing  perfumed  overflowing  redundant days  
were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet  heaped up 
flaked up  with rose-water snow  the starred and stately 
nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets  nursing 
at home in lonely pride  the memory of their absent 
conquering earls  the golden helmeted suns   for 
sleeping man   twas hard to choose between such winsome 
days and such seducing nights  but all the witcheries 
of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells 
and potencies to the outward world  inward they 
turned upon the soul  especially when the still mild hours 
of eve came on   then  memory shot her crystals as the 
clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights  and all these 
subtle agencies  more and more they wrought on ahab s 
texture  

old age is always wakeful   as if  the longer linked with 
life  the less man has to do with aught that looks like 
death  among sea-commanders  the old graybeards will 
oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck  
it was so with ahab   only that now  of late  he seemed 
so much to live in the open air  that truly speaking  his 
visits were more to the cabin  than from the cabin to the 
planks    it feels like going down into one s tomb   

156

he would mutter to himself    for an old captain like me 
to be descending this narrow scuttle  to go to my grave- 
dug berth  

so  almost every twenty-four hours  when the watches 
of the night were set  and the band on deck sentinelled 
the slumbers of the band below   and when if a rope was 
to be hauled upon the forecastle  the sailors flung it not 
rudely down  as by day  but with some cautiousness 
dropped it to its place  for fear of disturbing their slumber- 
ing shipmates   when this sort of steady quietude would 
begin to prevail  habitually  the silent steersman would 
watch the cabin-scuttle   and ere long the old man would 
emerge  gripping at the iron banister  to help his crippled 
way  some considerating touch of humanity was in 
him   for at times like these  he usually abstained from 
patrolling the quarter-deck   because to his wearied 
mates  seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel  
such would have been the reverberating crack and din 
of that bony step  that their dreams would have been of 
the crunching teeth of sharks  but once  the mood was 
on him too deep for common regardings   and as with 
heavy  lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from 
tanrail to mainmast  stubb  the odd second mate  came 
up from below  and with a certain unassured  deprecating 
humorousness  hinted that if captain ahab was pleased 
to walk the planks  then  no one could say nay   but 
there might be some way of muffling the noise   hinting 
something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe 
of tow  and the insertion into it  of the ivory heel  ah   
stubb  thou didst not know ahab then  

  am i a cannon-ball  stubb  said ahab    that thou 
wouldst wad me that fashion   but go thy ways   i had 
forgot  below to thy nightly grave   where such as ye 
sleep between shrouds  to use ye to the filling one at last  
down  dog  and kennel     



158 moby-dick 

 starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of 
the so suddenly scornful old man  stubb was speechless 
a moment   then said excitedly    i am not used to be 
spoken to that way  sir   i do but less than half like it  
sir   

  avast     gritted ahab between his set teeth  and 
violently moving away  as if to avoid some passionate 
temptation  

  no  sir   not yet   said stubb  emboldened    i will 
not tamely be called a dog  sir   

  then be called ten times a donkey  and a mule  and 
an ass  and begone  or i 11 clear the world of thee     

as he said this  ahab advanced upon him with such 
overbearing terrors in his aspect  that stubb involuntarily 
retreated  

  i was never served so before without giving a hard blow 
for it   muttered stubb  as he found himself descending 
the cabin-scuttle    it  s very queer  stop  stubb   
somehow  now  i don t well know whether to go back and 
strike him  or what  s that   down here on my knees 
and pray for him   yes  that was the thought coming 
up in me   but it would be the first time i ever did pray  
it  s queer   very queer   and he  s queer too   ay  take 
him fore and aft  he  s about the queerest old man stubb 
ever sailed with  how he flashed at me   his eyes like 
powder-pans   is he mad   anyway there  s something 
on his mind  as sure as there must be something on a deck 
when it cracks  he ain t in his bed now  either  more 
than three hours out of the twenty-four   and he don t 
sleep then  didn t that dough-boy  the steward  tell 
me that of a morning he always finds the old man s ham- 
mock clothes all rumpled and tumbled  and the sheets 
down at the foot  and the coverlid almost tied into knots  
and the pillow a sort of frightful hot  as though a baked 
brick had been on it   a hot old man   i guess he  s

got what some folks ashore call a conscience   it  s a kind 
of tic-dolly-row they say worse nor a toothache  well  
well   i don t know what it is  but the lord keep me from 
catching it  he  s full of riddles   i wonder what he goes 
into the after-hold for  every night  as dough -boy tells me 
he suspects   what  s that for  i should like to know   
who  s made appointments with him in the hold   ain t 
that queer  now   but there  s no telling  it  s the old 
game  here goes for a snooze  damn me  it  s worth a 
fellow s while to be born into the world  if only to fall right 
asleep  and now that i think of it  that  s about the first 
thing babies do  and that  s a sort of queer  too  damn 
me  but all things are queer  come to think of  em  but 
that  s against my principles  think not  is my eleventh  
commandment   and sleep when you can  is my twelfth  
 feo here goes again  but how  s that   didn t he call me 
a dog   blazes   he called me ten times a donkey  and 
piled a lot of jackasses on top of that   he might as well 
have kicked me  and done with it  maybe he did kick me  
and i didn t observe it  i was so taken all aback with his 
brow  somehow  it flashed like a bleached bone  what 
the devil  s the matter with me   i don t stand right 
on my legs  coming afoul of that old man has a sort of 
turned me wrong side out  by the lord  i must have 
been dreaming  though how 1 how   how   but the 
only way  s to stash it   so here goes to hammock again   
and in the morning  i  11 see how this plaguy juggling 
thinks over by daylight

the pipe 

when stubb had departed  ahab stood for a while leaning 
over the bulwarks   and then  as had been usual with him 
of late  calling a sailor of the watch  he sent him below for 
his ivory stool  and also his pipe  lighting the pipe at 
the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather- 
side of the deck  he sat and smoked  

in old norse times  the thrones of the sea-loving danish 
kings were fabricated  saith tradition  of the tusks of the 
narwhale  how could one look at ahab then  seated on 
that tripod of bones  without bethinking him of the 
royalty it symbolised   for a khan of the plank  and 
a king of the sea  and a great lord of leviathans was ahab  

some moments passed  during which the thick vapour 
came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs  which 
blew back again into his face    how now    he soliloquised 
at last  withdrawing the tube   this smoking no longer 
soothes  oh  my pipe   hard must it go with me if thy 
charm be gone   here have i been unconsciously toiling  
not pleasuring  ay  and ignorantly smoking to windward 
all the while   to windward  and with such nervous whiffs  
as if  like the dying whale  my final jets were the strongest 
and fullest of trouble  what business have i with this 
pipe   this thing that is meant for sereneness  to send up 
mild white vapours among mild white hairs  not among 
torn iron -gray locks like mine  i  11 smoke no more 

he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea  the fire 
hissed in the waves   the same instant the ship shot by 
the bubble the sinking pipe made  with slouched hat  
ahab lurchingly paced the planks

next morning stubb accosted flask  

  such a queer dream  king-post  i never had  you 
know the old man s ivory leg  well i dreamed he kicked 
me with it   and when i tried to kick back  upon my soul  
my little man  i kicked my leg right off   and then  
presto   ahab seemed a pyramid  and i  like a blazing 
fool  kept kicking at it  but what was still more curious  
flask you know how curious all dreams are through 
all this rage that i was in  i somehow seemed to be think- 
ing to myself  that after all  it was not much of an insult  
that kick from ahab    why   thinks i    what  s the 
row   it  s not a real leg  only a false leg   and there  s 
a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead 
thump  that  s what makes a blow from the hand  
flask  fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from 
a cane  the living member that makes the living insult  
my little man  and thinks i to myself afl the wnile  
mind  while i was stubbing my silly toes against that 
cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was it 
all  all the while  i say  i was thinking to myself   what  s 
his leg now  but a cane a whalebone cane  yes   
thinks i   it was only a playful cudgelling in fact  only 
a whaleboning that he gave me not a base kick  be- 
sides   thinks i    look at it once   why  the end of it 
the foot part what a small sort of end it is   whereas  if 
a broad-footed farmer kicked me  there  s a devilish broad 
insult  but this insult is whittled down to a point only

but now comes the greatest joke of the dream  flask  
while i was battering away at the pyramid  a sort of 
badger-haired old merman  with a hump on his back  
takes me by the shoulders  and slews me round    what 
are you  bout     says he  slid   man  but i was 
frightened  such a phiz   but  somehow  next moment 
i was over the fright    what am i about     says i at 
last    and what business is that of yours  i should like 
to know  mr  humpback   do you want a kick     by 
the lord  flask  i had no sooner said that  than he turned 
round his stern to me  bent over  and dragging up a lot 
of seaweed he had for a clout what do you think i saw   
why  thunder alive  man  his stern was stuck full of 
marling-spikes  with the points out  says i  on second 
thoughts    i guess i won t kick you  old fellow     wise 
stubb   said he    wise stubb     and kept muttering 
it all the time  a sort of eating of his own gums like a 
chimney hag  seeing he wasn t going to stop saying 
over his   wise stubb  wise stubb   i thought i might as 
well fall to kicking the pyramid again  but i had only 
just lifted my foot for it  when he roared out    stop that 
kicking       halloa   says i    what  s the matter now  
old fellow       look ye here   says he     let  s argue 
the insult  captain ahab kicked ye  didn t he       yes  
he did   says i  right here it was    very good   
says he   he used his ivory leg  didn t he       yes  he 
did   says i    weu  then   says he    wise stubb  what 
have you to complain of   didn t he kick with right 
goodwill   it wasn t a common pitch-pine leg he kicked 
with  was it   no  you were kicked by a great man  and 
with a beautiful ivory leg  stubb  it  s an honour   i 
consider it an honour  listen  wise stubb  in old 
england the greatest lords think it great glory to be 
slapped by a queen  and made garter-knights of   but  
be your boast  stubb  that ye were kicked by old ahab  



queen mab 163 

and made a wise man of  remember what i say   be 
kicked by him   account his kicks honours   and on no 
account kick back   for you can t help yourself  wise 
stubb  don t you see that pyramid     with that  he 
all of a sudden seemed somehow  in some queer fashion  
to swim off into the air  i snored   rolled over   and there 
i was in my hammock   now  what do you think of that 
dream  flask     

4 1 don t know   it seems a sort of foolish to me  
though   

4 maybe   maybe  but it  s made a wise man of me  
flask  d  ye see ahab standing there  sideways looking 
over the stern   well  the best thing you can do  flask  
is to let that old man alone   never speak to him  whatever 
he says  halloa   what  s that he shouts   hark     

  mast-head  there   look sharp  all of ye   there are 
whales hereabouts   if ye see a white one  split your 
lungs for him

cetology 

already we are boldly launched upon the deep   but 
soon we shall be lost in its unshored  harbourless immen- 
sities  ere that come to pass   ere the pequod a weedy 
hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the 
leviathan   at the outset it is but well to attend to a 
matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative 
understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations 
and allusions of all sorts which are to follow  

it is some systematised exhibition of the whale in his 
broad genera  that i would now fain put before you  yet 
is it no easy task  the classification of the constituents 
of a chaos  nothing less is here essayed  listen to what 
the best and latest authorities have laid down  

  no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which 
is entitled cetology   says captain scoresby  a d  1820  

  it is not my intention  were it in my power  to enter 
into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the 
cetacea into groups and families        utter confusion 
exists among the historians of this animal    sperm 
whale   says surgeon beale  a d  1839  

  unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable 
waters     impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of 
the cetacea     a field strewn with thorns     all these 
incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists   

thus speak of the whale  the great cuvier  and john 
hunter  and lesson  those lights of zoology and anatomy  
nevertheless  though of real knowledge there be little  

164 



cetology 165 

yet of books there are a plenty   and so in some small 
degree  with cetology  or the science of whales  many are 
the men  small and great  old and new  landsmen and sea- 
men  who have at large or in little  written of the whale  
run over a few   the authors of the bible   aristotle   
pliny   aldrovandi   sir thomas browne   gesner   
ray   linnaeus   rondeletius   willoughby   green   
artedi   sibbald   brisson   marten   lacepede   bonne- 
terre   desmarest   baron cuvier   frederick cuvier   
john hunter   owen   scoresby   beale   bennett   j  
ross browne   the author of miriam coffin   olmstead   
and the rev  t  cheever  but to what ultimate general- 
ising purpose all these have written  the above-cited 
extracts will show  

of the names in this list of whale authors  only those 
following owen ever saw living whales   and but one of 
them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman  
i mean captain scoresby  on the separate subject of 
the greenland or right whale  he is the best existing 
authority  but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing 
of the great sperm whale  compared with which the green- 
land whale is almost unworthy mentioning  and here 
be it said  that the greenland whale is an usurper upon 
the throne of the seas  he is not even by any means the 
largest of the whales  yet  owing to the long priority 
of his claims  and the profound ignorance which  till some 
seventy years back  invested the then fabulous or utterly 
unknown sperm whale  and which ignorance to this 
present day still reigns in all but some few scientific 
retreats and whale -ports   this usurpation has been every 
way complete  reference to nearly all the leviathanic 
allusions in the great poets of past days  will satisfy you 
that the greenland whale  without one rival  was to them 
the monarch of the seas  but the time has at last come 
for a new proclamation  this is charing cross   hear ye   



166 moby-dick 

good people all  the greenland whale is deposed  the 
great sperm whale now reigneth   

there are only two books in being which at all pretend 
to put the living sperm whale before you  and at the same 
time  in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt  
those books are beale s and bennett s   both in their 
time surgeons to the english south -sea whale -ships  and 
both exact and reliable men  the original matter 
touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is 
necessarily small   but so far as it goes  it is of excellent 
quality  though mostly confined to scientific description  
as yet  however  the sperm whale  scientific or poetic  
lives not complete in any literature  far above all other 
hunted whales  his is an unwritten life  

now the various species of whales need some sort of 
popular comprehensive classification  if only an easy 
outline one for the present  hereafter to be filled in all its 
departments by subsequent labourers  as no better 
man advances to take this matter in hand  i hereupon 
offer my own poor endeavours  i promise nothing 
complete   because any human thing supposed to be 
complete  must for that very reason infallibly be faulty  
i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of 
the various species  or in this place at least to much of 
any description  my object here is simply to project the 
draught of a systematisation of cetology  i am the 
architect  not the builder  

but it is a ponderous task   no ordinary letter-sorter 
in the post office is equal to it  to grope down into the 
bottom of the sea after them   to have one s hands 
among the unspeakable foundations  ribs  and very pelvis 
of the world   this is a fearful thing  what am i that i 
should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan   the 
awful tauntings in job might well appal me    will he 
 the leviathan  make a covenant with thee   behold the 



cetology 167 

hope of him is vain     but i have swam through libraries 
and sailed through oceans   i have had to do with whales 
with these visible hands   i am in earnest   and i will 
try  there are some preliminaries to settle  

first   the uncertain  unsettled condition of this 
science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by 
the fact  that in some quarters it still remains a moot point 
whether a whale be a fish  in his system of nature  
a d  1776  linnaeus declares    i hereby separate the whales 
from the fish  5 but of my own knowledge  i know that 
down to the year 1850  sharks and shad  ale wives and 
herring  against linnaeus  s express edict  were still found 
dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan  

the grounds upon which linnaeus would fain have 
banished the whales from the waters  he states as follows   
  on account of their warm bilocular heart  their lungs  
their movable eyelids  their hollow ears  penem intrantem 
feminam mammis lactantem   and finally    ex lege naturae 
jure meritoque   i submitted all this to my friends 
simeon macey and charley coffin  of nantucket  both 
messmates of mine in a certain voyage  and they united 
in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether 
insufficient   charley profanely hinted they were humbug   

be it known that  waiving all argument  i take the good 
old-fashioned ground that the whale is a fish  and call 
upon holy jonah to back me  this fundamental thing 
settled  the next point is  in what internal respect does 
the whale differ from other fish  above  linnaeus has 
given you those items  but in brief  they are those   
lungs and warm blood   whereas  all other fish are lung- 
less and cold-blooded  

next   how shall we define the whale  by his obvious 
externals  so as conspicuously to label him for all time to 
come   to be short  then  a whale is a spouting fish with 
a horizontal tail  there you have him  however con- 



168 moby-dick 

traded  that definition is the result of expanded medita- 
tion  a walrus spouts much like a whale  but the walrus 
is not a fish  because he is amphibious  but the last term 
of the definition is still more cogent  as coupled with the 
first  almost any one must have noticed that all the 
fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat  but a vertical  
or up-and-down tail  whereas  among spouting fish the 
tail  though it may be similarly shaped  invariably assumes 
a horizontal position  

by the above definition of what a whale is  i do by no 
means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea- 
creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best- 
informed nantucketers   nor  on the other hand  link 
with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien  1 
hence  all the smaller  spouting  and horizontal-tailed fish 
must be included in this ground-plan of cetology  now  
then  come the grand divisions of the entire whale host  

first   according to magnitude i divide the whales into 
three primary books  subdivisible into chapters   and 
these shall comprehend them all  both small and large  

i  the folio whale   ii  the octavo whale   
iii  the duodecimo whale  

as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale   
of the octavo  the grampus   of the duodecimo  the 
porpoise  

folios  among these i here include the following 
chapters   i  the sperm whale   ii  the right whale   
iii  the fin-lack whale   iv  the hump-backed whale   
v  the razor-back whale   vi  the sulphur-bottom whale  

book i   folio   chapter i   sperm whale   this 

1 i am aware that down to the present time  the fish styled lamatins 
and dugongs  pig-fish and sow-fish of the coffins of nantucket  are 
included by many naturalists among the whales  but as these pig-fish 
are a nosy  contemptible set  mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers  and 
feeding on wet hay  and especially as they do not spout  i deny their 
credentials as whales   and have presented them with their passports to 
quit the kingdom of cetology  



cetology 169 

whale  among the english of old vaguely known as the 
trumpa whale  and the physeter whale  and the anvil- 
headed whale  is the present cachalot of the french  and 
the pottsfisch of the germans  and the macrocephalus 
of the long words  he is  without doubt  the largest 
inhabitant of the globe   the most formidable of all 
whales to encounter   the most majestic in aspect   and 
lastly  by far the most valuable in commerce   he being 
the only creature from which that valuable substance  
spermaceti  is obtained  all his peculiarities will  in 
many other places  be enlarged upon  it is chiefly with 
his name that i now have to do  philologically con- 
sidered  it is absurd  some centuries ago  when the 
sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own 
proper individuality  and when his oil was only accident- 
ally obtained from the stranded fish   in those days 
spermaceti  it would seem  was popularly supposed to be 
derived from a creature identical with the one then known 
in england as the greenland or right whale  it was 
the idea also  that this same spermaceti was that quicken- 
ing humour of the greenland whale which the first 
syllable of the word literally expresses  in those times  
also  spermaceti was exceedingly scarce  not being used 
for light  but only as an ointment and medicament  it 
was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays 
buy an ounce of rhubarb  when  as i opine  in the course 
of time  the true nature of spermaceti became known  its 
original name was still retained by the dealers   no doubt 
to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant 
of its scarcity  and so the appellation must at last have 
come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this 
spermaceti was really derived  

book i   folio   chapter ii   right whale   in one 
respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans  being 
the one first regularly hunted by man  it yields the 



170 moby-dick 

article commonly known as whalebone or baleen   and 
the oil specially known as   whale oil   an inferior article 
in commerce  among the fishermen  he is indiscrimin- 
ately designated by all the following titles   the whale   
the greenland whale   the black whale   the great 
whale   the true whale   the right whale  there is a 
deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species 
thus multitudinously baptized  what then is the whale  
which i include in the second species of my folios   it is 
the great mysticetus of the english naturalists   the 
greenland whale of the english whalemen   the baleine 
ordinaire of the french whalemen   the growlands wal- 
fisch of the swedes  it is the whale which for more than 
two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and 
english in the arctic seas   it is the whale which the 
american fishermen have long pursued in the indian 
ocean  on the brazil banks  on the nor  -west coast  and 
various other parts of the world  designated by them 
right whale cruising-grounds  

some pretend to see a difference between the greenland 
whale of the english and the right whale of the ameri- 
cans  but they precisely agree in all their grand features   
nor has there yet been presented a single determinate 
fact upon which to ground a radical distinction  it is 
by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive 
differences  that some departments of natural history 
become so repellingly intricate  the right whale will 
be elsewhere treated of at some length  with reference to 
elucidating the sperm whale  

book i   folio   chapter iii   fin-back   under 
this head i reckon a monster which  by the various names 
of fin-back  tall-spout  and long-john  has been seen 
almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose 
distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the 
atlantic  in the new york packet -tracks  in the length 



cetology 171 

he attains  and in his baleen  the fin-back resembles the 
right whale  but is of a less portly girth  and a lighter 
colour  approaching to olive  his great lips present a 
cable-like aspect  formed by the intertwisting  slanting 
folds of large wrinkles  his grand distinguishing feature  
the fin  from which he derives his name  is often a con- 
spicuous object  this fin is some three or four feet long  
growing vertically from the hinder part of the back  of 
an angular shape  and with a very sharp-pointed end  
even if not the slightest other part of the creature be 
visible  this isolated fin will  at times  be seen plainly 
projecting from the surface  when the sea is moderately 
calm  and slightly marked with spherical ripples  and this 
gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the 
wrinkled surface  it may well be supposed that the watery 
circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial  with its 
style and wavy hour-lines graved on it  on that ahaz- 
dial the shadow often goes back  the fin-back is not 
gregarious  he seems a whale-hater  as some men are 
man-haters  very shy   always going solitary   unex- 
pectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most 
sullen waters   his straight and single lofty jet rising like 
a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain   gifted with 
such wondrous power and velocity in swimming  as to 
defy all present pursuit from man   this leviathan seems 
the banished and unconquerable cain of his race  bearing 
for his mark that style upon his back  from having the 
baleen in his mouth  the fin-back is sometimes included 
with the right whale  among a theoretic species denomin- 
ated whalebone whales  that is  whales with baleen  of 
these so-called whalebone whales  there would seem to be 
several varieties  most of which  however  are little known  
broad-nosed whales and beaked whales   pike -headed 
whales   bunched whales   under- jawed whales and 
rostrated whales  are the fishermen s names for a few sorts  



172 moby-dick 

in connection with this appellative of   whalebone 
whales  it is of great importance to mention  that how- 
ever such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitat- 
ing allusions to some kind of whales  yet it is in vain to 
attempt a clear classification of the leviathan  founded 
upon either his baleen  or hump  or fin  or teeth   not- 
withstanding that those marked parts or features very 
obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a 
regular system of cetology than any other detached 
bodily distinctions  which the whale  in his kinds  presents  
how then   the baleen  hump  back-fin  and teeth   
these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately 
dispersed among all sorts of whales  without any regard 
to what may be the nature of their structure in other and 
more essential particulars  thus  the sperm whale and 
the hump-backed whale  each has a hump   but there 
the similitude ceases  then  this same hump-backed 
whale and the greenland whale  each of these has baleen   
but there again the similitude ceases  and it is just the 
same with the other parts above mentioned  in various 
sorts of whales  they form such irregular combinations   
or  in the case of any one of them detached  such an 
irregular isolation   as utterly to defy all general methodis- 
ation formed upon such a basis  on this rock every one 
of the whale -naturalists has split  

but it may possibly be conceived that  in the internal 
parts of the whale  in his anatomy there  at least  we 
shall be able to hit the right classification  nay   what 
thing  for example  is there in the greenland whale s 
anatomy more striking than his baleen   yet we have 
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify 
the greenland whale  and if you descend into the bowels 
of the various leviathans  why there you will not find 
distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematiser 
as those external ones already enumerated  what then 



cetology 173 

remains   nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily  
in their entire liberal volume  and boldly sort them that 
way  and this is the bibliographical system here adopted   
and it is the only one that can possibly succeed  for it 
alone is practicable  to proceed  

book i   folio   chapter iv   hump-back   this 
whale is often seen on the northern american coast  he 
has been frequently captured there  and towed into 
harbour  he has a great pack on him like a peddler   or 
you might call him the elephant and castle whale  at 
any rate  the popular name for him does not sufficiently 
distinguish him  since the sperm whale also has a hump  
though a smaller one  his oil is not very valuable  he 
has baleen  he is the most gamesome and light-hearted 
of all the whales  making more gay foam and white water 
generally than any other of them  

book i   folio   chapter v   razor-back   of this 
whale little is known but his name  i have seen him at a 
distance off cape horn  of a retiring nature  he eludes 
both hunters and philosophers  though no coward  he 
has never yet shown any part of him but his back  which 
rises in a long sharp ridge  let him go  i know little 
more of him  nor does anybody else  

book i   folio   chapter vi   sulphur-bottom   
another retiring gentleman  with a brimstone belly  
doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in 
some of his profounder divings  he is seldom seen   at 
least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern 
seas  and then always at too great a distance to study his 
countenance  he is never chased   he would run away 
with rope -walks of line  prodigies are told of him  
adieu  sulphur-bottom   i can say nothing more that is 
true of ye  nor can the oldest nantucketer  

thus ends book i   folio   and now begins book ii  
 octavo   



174 moby-dick 

octavos  1 these embrace the whales of middling 
magnitude  among which at present may be numbered   
i  the grampus   ii  the black fish   iii  the narwhale   
iv  the killer   v  the thrasher  

book ii   octavo   chapter i   grampus   though 
this fish  whose loud sonorous breathing  or rather blowing  
has furnished a proverb to landsmen  is so well known 
a denizen of the deep  yet is he not popularly classed 
among whales  but possessing all the grand distinctive 
features of the leviathan  most naturalists have recog- 
nised him for one  he is of moderate octavo size  varying 
from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length  and of corre- 
sponding dimensions round the waist  he swims in 
herds   he is never regularly hunted  though his oil is 
considerable in quantity  and pretty good for light  by 
some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory 
of the advance of the great sperm whale  

book ii   octavo   chapter ii   black fish   i give 
the popular fishermen s names for all these fish  for gener- 
ally they are the best  where any name happens to be 
vague or inexpressive  i shall say so  and suggest another  
i do so now  touching the black fish  so called  because 
blackness is the rule among almost all whales  so  call 
him the hyena whale  if you please  his voracity is well 
known  and from the circumstance that the inner angles 
of his lips are curved upward  he carries an everlasting 
mephistophelean grin on his face  this whale averages 
some sixteen or eighteen feet in length  he is found in 
almost all latitudes  he has a peculiar way of showing 
his dorsal hooked fin in swimming  which looks something 
like a roman nose  when not more profitably employed  

1 why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain  
because  while the whales of this order  though smaller than those of the 
former order  nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure  
yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in its diminished form does not 
preserve the shape of the folio volume  but the octavo volume does  



cetology 175 

the sperm-whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena 
whale  to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic 
employment as some frugal housekeepers  in the absence 
of company  and quite alone by themselves  burn un- 
savoury tallow instead of odorous wax  though their 
blubber is very thin  some of these whales will yield you 
upward of thirty gallons of oil  

book ii   octavo   chapter iii   narwhale   that is  
nostril whale  another instance of a curiously named 
whale  so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being 
originally mistaken for a peaked nose  the creature is 
some sixteen feet in length  while its horn averages five 
feet  though some exceed ten  and even attain to fifteen 
feet  strictly speaking  this horn is but a lengthened 
tusk  growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed 
from the horizontal  but it is only found on the sinister 
side  which has an ill effect  giving its owner something 
analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man  
what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers  it 
would be hard to say  it does not seem to be used like 
the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish   though some 
sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake 
in turning over the bottom of the sea for food  charley 
coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer   for the nar- 
whale  rising to the surface of the polar sea  and finding 
it sheeted with ice  thrusts his horn up  and so breaks 
through  but you cannot prove either of these surmises 
to be correct  my own opinion is  that however this one- 
sided horn may really be used by the narwhale however 
that may be it would certainly be very convenient to 
him for a folder in reading pamphlets  the narwhale 
i have heard called the tusked whale  the horned whale  
and the unicorn whale  he is certainly a curious 
example of the unicornism to be found in almost every 
kingdom of animated nature  from certain cloistered 



176 moby-dick 

old authors i have gathered that this same sea-unicorn s 
horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote 
against poison  and as such  preparations of it brought 
immense prices  it was also distilled to a volatile salts 
for fainting ladies  the same way that the horns of the 
male deer are manufactured into hartshorn  originally 
it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity  
black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his 
return from that voyage  when queen bess did gallantly 
wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of green- 
wich palace  as his bold ship sailed down the thames   
  when sir martin returned from that voyage   saith black 
letter    on bended knees he presented to her highness 
a prodigious long horn of the narwhale  which for a long 
period after hung in the castle at windsor   an irish 
author avers that the earl of leicester  on bended knees  
did likewise present to her highness another horn  per- 
taining to a land-beast of the unicorn nature  

the narwhale has a very picturesque  leopard-like look  
being of a milk-white ground colour  dotted with round 
and oblong spots of black  his oil is very superior  clear 
and fine   but there is little of it  and he is seldom hunted  
he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas  

book ii   octavo   chapter iv   killer   of this 
whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer  and 
nothing at all to the professed naturalist  from what i 
have seen of him at a distance  i should say that he was 
about the bigness of a grampus  he is very savage a 
sort of feegee fish  he sometimes takes the great folio 
whale by the lip  and hangs there like a leech  till the 
mighty brute is worried to death  the killer is never 
hunted  i never heard what sort of oil he has  excep- 
tion might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale  
on the ground of its indistinctness  for we are all killers  
on land and on sea   bonapartes and sharks included  



cetology 177 

book ii   octavo   chapter v   thrasher   this 
gentleman is famous for his tail  which he uses for a 
ferule in thrashing his foes  he mounts the folio 
whale s back  and as he swims  he works his passage by 
flogging him   as some schoolmasters get along in the 
world by a similar process  still less is known of the 
thrasher than of the killer  both are outlaws  even in 
the lawless seas  

thus ends book ii   octavo   and begins book iii  
 duodecimo   

duodecimos  these include the smaller whales  
i  the huzza porpoise   ii  the algerine porpoise   iii  
the mealy-mouthed porpoise  

to those who have not chanced specially to study the 
subject  it may possibly seem strange  that fishes not 
commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled 
among whales a word which  in the popular sense  
always conveys an idea of hugeness  but the creatures 
set down above as duodecimos are infallibly whales  by 
the terms of my definition of what a whale is i e  a 
spouting fish  with a horizontal tail  

book iii   duodecimo   chapter i   huzza porpoise   
this is the common porpoise found almost all over the 
globe  the name is of my own bestowal   for there are 
more than one sort of porpoises  and something must be 
done to distinguish them  i call him thus  because he 
always swims in hilarious shoals  which upon the broad 
sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a 
fourth-of-july crowd  their appearance is generally 
hailed with delight by the mariner  full of fine spirits  
they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward  
they are the lads that always live before the wind  they 
are accounted a lucky omen  if you yourself can with- 
stand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish  then 
heaven help ye   the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not

in ye  a well-fed  plump huzza porpoise will yield you 
one good gallon of good oil  but the fine and delicate 
fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable  
it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers  sailors 
put it on their hones  porpoise meat is good eating  you 
know  it may never have occurred to you that a por- 
poise spouts  indeed  his spout is so small that it is not 
very readily discernible  but the next time you have a 
chance  watch him   and you will then see the great 
sperm whale himself in miniature  

book iii   duodecimo   chapter ii   algerine por- 
poise   a pirate  very savage  he is only found  i 
think  in the pacific  he is somewhat larger than the 
huzza porpoise  but much of the same general make  
provoke him  and he will buckle to a shark  i have 
lowered for him many times  but never yet saw him 
captured  

book iii   duodecimo   chapter iii   mealy-mouthed 
porpoise   the largest kind of porpoise   and only 
found in the pacific  so far as it is known  the only 
english name  by which he has hitherto been designated  
 is that of the fishers right-whale porpoise  from the 
circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of 
that folio  in shape  he differs in some degree from the

indeed  he is of quite a neat and gentleman -like figure  
he has no fins on his back  most other porpoises have   
he has a lovely tail  and sentimental indian eyes of a 
hazel hue  but his mealy-mouth spoils all  though 
his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable  
yet a boundary line  distinct as the mark in a ship s 
hull  called the   bright waist  that line streaks him from 
stem to stern  with two separate colours  black above and 
white below  the white comprises part of his head  and 
the whole of his mouth  which makes him look as if he

a most mean and mealy aspect   his oil is much like 

that of the common porpoise  

        

beyond the duodecimo  this system does not proceed  
inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales  
above  you have all the leviathans of note  but there 
are a rabble of uncertain  fugitive  half-fabulous whales  
which  as an american whaleman  i know by reputation  
but not personally  i shall enumerate them by their 
forecastle appellations   for possibly such a list may be 
valuable to future investigators  who may complete what 
i have here but begun  if any of the following whales 
shall hereafter be caught and marked  then he can readily 
be incorporated into this system  according to his folio  
octavo  or duodecimo magnitude   the bottle-nose 
whale   the junk whale   the pudding-headed whale   
the cape whale   the leading whale   the cannon 
whale   the scragg whale   the coppered whale   the 
elephant whale   the iceberg whale   the quog whale   
the blue whale  etc  from icelandic  dutch  and old 
english authorities  there might be quoted other lists of 
uncertain whales  blessed with all manner of uncouth 
names  but i omit them as altogether obsolete   and 
can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds  full of 
leviathanism  but signifying nothing  

finally   it was stated at the outset  that this system 
would not be here  and at once  perfected  you cannot 
but plainly see that i have kept my word  but i now 
leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished  even 
as the great cathedral of cologne was left  with the crane 
still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower  
for small erections may be finished by their first archi-

posterity  god keep me from ever completing anything  
this whole book is but a draught nay  but the draught

chapter xxxiii 

the specksynder 

concerning the officers of the whale-craft  this seems 
as good a place as any to set down a little domestic 
peculiarity on shipboard  arising from the existence of 
the harpooneer class of officers  a class unknown of course 
in any other marine than the whale-fleet  

the large importance attached to the harpooneer j s 
vocation is evinced by the fact  that originally in the old 
dutch fishery  two centuries and more ago  the command 
of a whale -ship was not wholly lodged in the person now 
called the captain  but was divided between him and an 
officer called the specksynder  literally this word 
means fat -cutter   usage  however  in time made it 
equivalent to chief harpooneer  in those days  the 
captain s authority was restricted to the navigation and 
general management of the vessel   while over the whale- 
hunting department and all its concerns  the specksynder 
or chief harpooneer reigned supreme  in the british 
greenland fishery  under the corrupted title of speck- 
sioneer  this old dutch official is still retained  but his 
former dignity is sadly abridged  at present he ranks 
simply as senior harpooneer   and as such  is but one of 
the captain s more inferior subalterns  nevertheless  as 
upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of 
a whaling voyage largely depends  and since in the ameri- 
can fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat  
but under certain circumstances  night-watches on a 
whaling -ground  the command of the ship s deck is also 

180 



the specksynder 181 

his   therefore the grand political maxim of the sea 
demands  that he should nominally live apart from the 
men before the mast  and be in some way distinguished 
as their professional superior   though always  by them  
familiarly regarded as their social equal  

now  the grand distinction drawn between officer and 
man at sea is this the first lives aft  the last forward  
hence  in whale-ships and merchantmen alike  the mates 
have their quarters with the captain   and so  too  in 
most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged 
in the after part of the ship  that is to say  they take 
their meals in the captain s cabin  and sleep in a place 
indirectly communicating with it  

though the long period of a southern whaling voyage 
 by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by 
man   the peculiar perils of it  and the community of 
interest prevailing among a company  all of whom  high 
or low  depend for their profits  not upon fixed wages  
but upon their common luck  together with their common 
vigilance  intrepidity  and hard work   though all these 
things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous 
discipline than in merchantmen generally   yet  never 
mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these 
whalemen may  in some primitive instances  live together   
for all that  the punctilious externals  at least  of the 
quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed  and in no 
instance done away  indeed  many are the nantucket 
ships in which you will see the skipper parading his 
quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in 
any military navy   nay  extorting almost as much out- 
ward homage as if he wore the imperial purple  and not 
the shabbiest of pilot-cloth  

and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod 
was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption   
and though the only homage he ever exacted was im- 



182 moby-dick 

plicit  instantaneous obedience   though he required no 
man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon 
the quarter-deck   and though there were times when  
owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events 
hereafter to be detailed  he addressed them in unusual 
terms  whether of condescension or in terrorem  or other- 
wise   yet even captain ahab was by no means unob- 
servant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea  

nor  perhaps  will it fail to be eventually perceived  that 
behind those forms and usages  as it were  he sometimes 
masked himself   incidentally making use of them for 
other and more private ends than they were legitimately 
intended to subserve  that certain sultanism of his 
brain  which had otherwise in a good degree remained 
unmanifested   through those forms that same sultanism 
 became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship  for be a 
man s intellectual superiority what it will  it can never 
assume the practical  available supremacy over other men  
without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrench- 
ments  always  in themselves  more or less paltry and base  
this it is  that forever keeps god s true princes of the 
empire from the world s hustings   and leaves the highest 
honours that this air can give  to those men who become 
famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice 
hidden handful of the divine inert  than through their 
undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass  
such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme 
political superstitions invest them  that in some royal 
instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted 
potency  but when  as in the case of nicholas the czar  
the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an 
imperial brain   then  the plebeian herds crouch abased 
before the tremendous centralisation  nor will the 
tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitable - 
ness in its fullest sweep and direct swing  ever forget a 



the specks ynder 183 

hint  incidentally so important in his art  as the one now 
alluded to  

but ahab  my captain  still moves before me in all 
his nantucket grimness and shagginess   and in this 
episode touching emperors and kings  i must not conceal 
that i have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like 
him   and  therefore  all outward majestical trappings 
and housings are denied me  oh  ahab   what shall be 
grand in thee  it must needs be plucked at from the skies  
and dived for in the deep  and featured in the unbodied 
air   



chapter xxxiv 

the cabin-table 

it is noon   and dough-boy  the steward  thrusting his 
pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle  announces 
dinner to his lord and master   who  sitting in the lee 
quarter-boat  has just been taking an observation of the 
sun   and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the 
smooth  medallion-shaped tablet  reserved for that daily 
purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg  from his 
complete inattention to the tidings  you would think that 
moody ahab had not heard his menial  but presently  
catching hold of the mizen shrouds  he swings himself 
to the deck  and in an even  unexhilarated voice  saying  
 dinner  mr  starbuck   disappears into the  cabin  

when the last echo of his sultan s step has died away  
and starbuck  the first emir  has every reason to suppose 
that he is seated  then starbuck rouses from his quietude  
takes a few turns along the planks  and  after a grave peep 
into the binnacle  says  with some touch of pleasantness  
  dinner  mr  stubb   and descends the scuttle  the 
second emir lounges about the rigging a while  and then 
slightly shaking the main-brace  to see whether it be 
all right with that important rope  he likewise takes up 
the old burden  and with a rapid   dinner  mr  flask   
follows after his predecessors  

but the third emir  now seeing himself all alone on the 
quarter-deck  seems to feel relieved from some curious 
restraint   for  tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all 
sorts of directions  and kicking off his shoes  he strikes 

184 



the cabin-table 185 

into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over 
the grand turk s head   and then  by a dexterous sleight  
pitching his cap up into the mizen-top for a shelf  he goes 
down rollicking  so far at least as he remains visible from 
the deck  reversing all other processions by bringing up 
the rear with music  but ere stepping into the cabin 
doorway below  he pauses  ships a new face altogether  
and then  independent  hilarious little flask enters king 
ahab s presence  in the character of abjectus  or the 
slave  

it is not the least among the strange things bred by the 
intense artificialness of sea-usages  that while in the open 
air of the deck some officers will  upon provocation  bear 
themselves boldly and defyingly enough toward their com- 
mander   yet  ten to one  let those very officers the next 
moment go down to their customary dinner in that same 
commander s cabin  and straightway their inoffensive  
not to say deprecatory and humble air toward him  as 
he sits at the head of the table   this is marvellous  some- 
times most comical  wherefore this difference   a 
problem   perhaps not  to have been belshazzar  
king of babylon   and to have been belshazzar  not 
haughtily but courteously  therein certainly must have 
been some touch of mundane grandeur  but he who in 
the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his 
own private dinner-table of invited guests  that man s 
unchallenged power and dominion of individual influ- 
ence for the time   that man s royalty of state transcends 
belshazzar  s  for belshazzar was not the greatest  who 
has but once dined his friends  has tasted what it is to be 
caesar  it is a witchery of social czarship which there 
is no withstanding  now  if to this consideration you 
superadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster  then  
by inference  you will derive the cause of that peculiarity 
of sea-life just mentioned  



186 moby-dick 

over his ivory-inlaid table  ahab presided like a mute  
maned sea-lion on the white coral beach  surrounded by 
his warlike but still deferential cubs  in his own proper 
turn  each officer waited to be served  they were as 
little children before ahab   and yet  in ahab  there 
seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance  with 
one mind  their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man s 
knife  as he carved the chief dish before him  i do not 
suppose that for the world they would have profaned 
that moment with the slightest observation  even upon 
so neutral a topic as the weather  no   and when 
reaching out his knife and fork  between which the slice 
of beef was locked  ahab thereby motioned starbuck s 
plate toward him  the mate received his meat as though 
receiving alms   and cut it tenderly   and a little started 
if  perchance  the knife grazed against the plate   and 
chewed it noiselessly   and swallowed it  not without 
circumspection  for  like the coronation banquet at 
frankfort  where the german emperor profoundly dines 
with the seven imperial electors  so these cabin meals 
were somehow solemn meals  eaten in awful silence   and 
yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation   only he 
himself was dumb  what a relief it was to choking stubb  
when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below  and 
poor little flask  he was the youngest son  and little boy 
of this weary family party  his were the shin-bones 
of the saline beef   his would have been the drumsticks  
for flask to have presumed to help himself  this must 
have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first 
degree  had he helped himself at that table  doubtless  
never more would he have been able to hold his head up 
in this honest world   nevertheless  strange to say  ahab 
never forbade him  and had flask helped himself  the 
chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it  
least of all  did flask presume to help himself to butter  



the cabin-table 187 

whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to 
him  on account of its clotting his clear  sunny com- 
plexion   or whether he deemed that  on so long a voyage 
in such marketless waters  butter was at a premium  and 
therefore was not for him  a subaltern   however it was  
flask  alas   was a butterless man   

another thing  flask was the last person down at the 
dinner  and flask is the first man up  consider   for 
hereby flask s dinner was badly jammed in point of time  
starbuck and stubb both had the start of him   and yet 
they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear  if 
stubb even  who is but a peg higher than flask  happens 
to have but a small appetite  and soon shows symptoms 
of concluding his repast  then flask must bestir himself  
he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day   for 
it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the 
deck  therefore it was that flask once admitted in 
private  that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an 
officer  from that moment he had never known what it 
was to be otherwise than hungry  more or less  for 
what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger  as keep 
it immortal hi him  peace and satisfaction  thought 
flask  have forever departed from my stomach  i am 
an officer   but  how i wish i could fist a bit of old- 
fashioned beef in the forecastle  as i used to when i was 
before the mast  there  s the fruits of promotion now   
there  s the vanity of glory   there  s the insanity of life   
besides  if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod 
had a grudge against flask in flask s official capacity  all 
that sailor had to do  in order to obtain ample vengeance  
was to go aft at dinner-time  and get a peep at flask 
through the cabin skylight  sitting silly and dumfoundered 
before awful ahab  

now  ahab and his three mates formed what may be 
called the first table in the pequod  s cabin  after their 



188 moby-dick 

departure  taking place in inverted order to their arrival  
the canvas cloth was cleared  or rather was restored to 
some hurried order by the pallid steward  and then the 
three harpooneers were bidden to the feast  they being 
its residuary legatees  they made a sort of temporary 
servants  hall of the high and mighty cabin  

in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint 
and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain s table  
was the entire care -free licence and ease  the almost frantic 
democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers  
while their masters  the mates  seemed afraid of the 
sound of the hinges of their own jaws  the harpooneers 
chewed their food with such a relish that there was a 
report to it  they dined like lords   they filled their 
bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices  
such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego  
that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast  
often the pale dough-boy was fain to bring on a great 
baron of salt-junk  seemingly quarried out of the solid 
ox  and if he were not lively about it  if he did not go 
with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump  then tashtego had an 
ungeiitlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork 
at his back  harpoon- wise  and once daggoo  seized 
with a sudden humour  assisted dough-boy s memory by 
snatching him up bodily  and thrusting his head into a 
great empty wooden trencher  while tashtego  knife in 
hand  began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping 
him  he was naturally a very nervous  shuddering sort 
of little fellow  this broad-faced steward   the progeny 
of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse  and what 
with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab  
and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three 
savages  dough-boy s whole life was one continual lip- 
quiver  commonly  after seeing the harpooneers fur- 
nished with all things they demanded  he would escape 



the cabin-table 189 

from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining  and 
fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door  
till all was over  

it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against 
tashtego  opposing his filed teeth to the indian s   cross- 
wise to them  daggoo seated on the floor  for a bench 
would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low 
carlines   at every motion of his colossal limbs  making 
the low cabin framework to shake  as when an african 
elephant goes passenger in a ship  but for all this  the 
great negro was wonderfully abstemious  not to say dainty  
it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively 
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused 
through so broad  baronial  and superb a person  but  
doubtless  this noble savage fed strong and drank deep 
of the abounding element of air   and through his dilated 
nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds  not by 
beef or by bread are giants made or nourished  but 
queequeg  he had a mortal  barbaric smack of the lip in 
eating an ugly sound enough so much so  that the 
trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether any 
marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms  and when 
he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce 
himself  that his bones might be picked  the simple -witted 
steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him 
in the pantry  by his sudden fits of the palsy  nor did 
the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their 
pockets  for their lances and other weapons   and with 
which whetstones  at dinner  they would ostentatiously 
sharpen their knives   that grating sound did not at all 
tend to tranquillise poor dough-boy  how could he 
forget that in his island days  queequeg  for one  must 
certainly have been guilty of some murderous  convivial 
indiscretions  alas   dough-boy   hard fares the white 
waiter who waits upon cannibals  not a napkin should

he carry on his arm  but a buckler  in good time  
though  to his great delight  the three salt-sea warriors 
would rise and depart   to his credulous  fable-mongering 
ears  all their martial bones jingling in them at every step  
like moorish scimitars in scabbards  

but  though these barbarians dined in the cabin  and 
nominally lived there   still  being anything but seden- 
tary in their habits  they were scarcely ever in it except 
at meal-times  and just before sleeping-time  when they 
passed through it to their own peculiar quarters  

in this one matter  ahab seemed no exception to most 
american whale-captains  who  as a set  rather incline to 
the opinion that by rights the ship s cabin belongs to 
them   and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else 
is  at any time  permitted there  so that  in real truth  
the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more 
properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in 
it  for when they did enter it  it was something as a 
street-door enters a house   turning inward for a moment  
only to be turned out the next   and  as a permanent 
thing  residing in the open air  nor did they lose much 
hereby   in the cabin was no companionship   socially  
ahab was inaccessible  though nominally included in 
the census of christendom  he was still an alien to it  
he lived in the world  as the last of the grizzly bears lived 
in settled missouri  and as when spring and summer 
had departed  that wild logan of the woods  burying 
himself in the hollow of a tree  lived out the winter there  
sucking his own paws   so  in his inclement  howling old 
age  ahab s soul  shut up in the caved trunk of his body  
there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom   



chapter xxxv 

the mast-head 

it was during the more pleasant weather  that in due 
rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came 
round  

in most american whalemen the mast-heads are 
manned almost simultaneously with the vessel s leaving 
her port - r even though she may have fifteen thousand 
miles  and more  to sail ere reaching her proper cruising- 
ground  and if  after a three  four  or five years  voyage 
she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her 
say  an empty vial even then her mast-heads are kept 
manned to the last   and not till her skysail-poles sail 
in among the spires of the port  does she altogether relin- 
quish the hope of capturing one whale more  

now  as the business of standing mast-heads  ashore or 
afloat  is a very ancient and interesting one  let us in some 
measure expatiate here  i take it  that the earliest 
standers of mast-heads were the old egyptians   because  
in all my researches  i find none prior to them  for 
though their progenitors  the builders of babel  must 
doubtless  by their tower  have intended to rear the 
loftiest mast-head in all asia  or africa either   yet  ere 
the final truck was put to it  as that great stone mast of 
theirs may be said to have gone by the board  in the dread 
gale of god s wrath   therefore  we cannot give these 
babel builders priority over the egyptians  and that 
the egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers is 
an assertion based upon the general belief among archseo- 

191 



192 moby-dick 

legists  that the first pyramids were founded for astro- 
nomical purposes   a theory singularly supported by the 
peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those 
edifices   whereby  with prodigious long upliftings of their 
legs  those old astronomers were wont to mount to the 
apex  and sing out for new stars   even as the look-outs 
of a modern ship sing out for a sail  or a whale just bearing 
in sight  in saint stylites  the famous christian hermit 
of old times  who built him a lofty stone pillar in the 
desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its 
summit  hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle   
in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless 
stander of mast-heads   who was not to be driven from 
his place by fogs or frosts  rain  hail  or sleet   but vali- 
antly facing everything out to the last  literally died at 
his post  of modern standers of mast-heads we have 
but a lifeless set   mere stone  iron  and bronze men   who  
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale  are still 
entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon 
discovering any strange sight  there is napoleon   who  
upon the top of the column of vendome  stands with arms 
folded  some one hundred and fifty feet in the air   care- 
less  now  who rules the decks below   whether louis- 
philippe  louis blanc  or louis the devil  great 
washington  too  stands high aloft on his towering main- 
mast in baltimore  and like one of hercules  pillars  his 
column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which 
few mortals will go  admiral nelson  also  on a capstan 
of gun-metal  stands his mast-head in trafalgar square   
and ever when most obscured by that london smoke  
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there   for where 
there is smoke  must be fire  but neither great washing- 
ton  nor napoleon  nor nelson  will answer a single hail 
from below  however madly invoked to befriend by their 
counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze   



the mast-head 193 

however it  may be surmised  that their spirits penetrate 
through the thick haze of the future  and descry what 
shoals and what rocks must be shunned  

it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect 
the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea   
but that in truth it is not so  is plainly evinced by an item 
for which obed macy  the sole historian of nantucket  
stands accountable  the worthy obed tells us  that in 
the early times of the whale-fishery  ere ships were regu- 
larly launched in pursuit of the game  the people of that 
island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast  to which 
the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats  some- 
thing as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house  a few years 
ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of 
new zealand  who  upon descrying the game  gave notice 
to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach  but this 
custom has now become obsolete   turn we then to the 
one proper mast-head  that of a whale-ship at sea  the 
three mast-heads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset   
the seamen taking their regular turns  as at the helm   
and relieving each other every two hours  in the serene 
weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast- 
head   nay  to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful  
there you stand  a hundred feet above the silent decks  
  striding along the deep  as if the masts were gigantic 
  stilts  while beneath you and between your legs  as it 
were  swim the hugest monsters of the sea  even as ships 
once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at 
old rhodes  there you stand  lost in the infinite series 
of the sea  with nothing ruffled but the waves  the 
tranced ship indolently rolls   the drowsy trade winds 
 blow   everything resolves you into languor  for the 
most part  in this tropic whaling life  a sublime unevent- 
mness invests you   you hear no news   read no gazettes

delude you into unnecessary excitements   you hear of 
no domestic afflictions   bankrupt securities   fall of 
stocks   are never troubled with the thought of what you 
shall have for dinner for all your meals for three years 
and more are snugly stowed in casks  and your bill of fare 
is immutable  

in one of those southern whalemen  on a long three or 
four years  voyage  as often happens  the sum of the various 
hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several 
entire months  and it is much to be deplored that the 
place to which you devote so considerable a portion of 
the whole term of your natural life  should be so sadly 
destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitive- 
ness  or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feel- 
ing  such as pertains to a bed  a hammock  a hearse  a 
sentry-box  a pulpit  a coach  or any other of those small 
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate 
themselves  your most usual point of perch is the head 
of the t  -gallant-mast  where you stand upon two thin 
parallel sticks  almost peculiar to whalemen  called the

beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a 
bull s horns  to be sure  in cold weather you may carry 
your house aloft with you  in the shape of a watch-coat   
but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more 
of a house than the unclad body   for as the soul is glued 
inside of its fleshly tabernacle  and cannot freely move 
about in it  nor even move out of it  without running great 
risk of perishing  like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the 
snowy alps in winter    so a watch-coat is not so much 
of a house as it is a mere envelope  or additional skin

concerning all this  it is much to be deplored that the 



the mast-head 195 

mast-heads of a southern whale -ship are unprovided 
with those enviable little tents or pulpits  called crow s- 
nests  in which the look-outs of a greenland whaler are 
protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas  
in the fireside narrative of captain sleet  entitled a 
voyage among the icebergs  in quest of the greenland whale  
and incidentally for the re-discovery of the lost icelandic 
colonies of old greenland   in this admirable volume  all 
standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly 
circumstantial account of the then recently invented 
crow s-nest of the glacier  which was the name of captain 
sleet s good craft  he called it the sleet s crow s-nest  in 
honour of himself   he being the original inventor and 
patentee  and free from all ridiculous false delicacy  and 
holding that if we call our own children after our own 
names  we fathers being the original inventors and 
patentees   so likewise should we denominate after our- 
selves any other apparatus we may beget  in shape  
the sleet s crow s-nest is something like a large tierce or 
pipe   it is open above  however  where it is furnished 
with a movable side -screen to keep to windward of your 
head in a hard gale  being fixed on the summit of the 
mast  you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in 
the bottom  on the after side  or side next the stern of 
the ship  is a comfortable seat  with a locker underneath 
for umbrellas  comforters  and coats  in front is a 
leather rack  hi which to keep your speaking trumpet  
pipe  telescope  and other nautical conveniences  when 
captain sleet in person stood his mast-head hi this crow s- 
nest of his  he tells us that he always had a rifle with him 
 also fixed in the rack   together with a powder-flask and 
shot  for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales  
or vagrant sea-unicorns infesting those waters   for you 
cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to 
the resistance of the water  but to shoot down upon them

is a very different thing  now  it was plainly a labour 
of love for captain sleet to describe  as he does  all the 
little detailed conveniences of his crow s-nest   but though 
he so enlarges upon many of these  and though he treats 
us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this 
crow s-nest  with a small compass he kept there for the 
purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what 
is called the   local attraction   of all binnacle magnets   
an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron 
in the ship s planks  and in the glacier s case  perhaps  to 
there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths 
among her crew   i say  that though the captain is very 
discreet and scientific here  yet  for all his learned   bin- 
nacle deviations     azimuth compass observations   and 
  approximate errors   he knows very well  captain sleet  
that he was not so much immersed in those profound 
magnetic meditations  as to fail being attracted occasion- 
ally toward that well-replenished little case-bottle  so 
nicely tucked in on one side of his crow s-nest  within 
easy reach of his hand  though  upon the whole  i 
greatly admire and even love the brave  the honest  and 
learned captain   yet i take it very ill of him that he 
should so utterly ignore that case-bottle  seeing what a 
faithful friend and comforter it must have been  while 
with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying 
the mathematics aloft there in that bird s nest within 
three or four perches of the pole  

but if we southern whale -fishers are not so snugly 
housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenland men 
were   yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced 
by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive 
seas in which we south fishers mostly float  for one  i 
used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely  resting hi 
the top to have a chat with queequeg  or anyone else off 
duty whom i might find there   then ascending a littl

way further  and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail- 
yard  take a preliminary view of the watery pastures  
and so at last mount to my ultimate destination  

let me make a clean breast of it here  and frankly 
admit that i kept but sorry guard  with the problem 
of the universe revolving in me  how could i being left 
completely to myself at such a thought-engendering alti- 
tude  how could i but lightly hold my obligations to 
observe all whale -ships  standing orders    keep your 
weather-eye open  and sing out every time     

and let me in this place movingly admonish you  ye 
shipowners of nantucket   beware of enlisting in your 
vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye   
given to unseasonable meditativeness   and who offers 
to ship with the phsedon instead of bowditch in his head  
beware of such an one  i say   your whales must be seen 
before they can be killed   and this sunken-eyed young 
platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world  and 
never make you one pint of sperm the richer  nor are 
these monitions at all unneeded  for nowadays  the 
whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic  
melancholy  and absent-minded young men  disgusted 
with the carking cares of earth  and seeking sentiment in 
tar and blubber  childe harold not unfrequently perches 
himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed 
whale-ship  and in moody phrase ejaculates   

1 roll on  thou deep and dark blue ocean  roll   
ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain   

very often do the captains of such ships take those 
absent-minded young philosophers to task  upbraiding 
them with not feeling sufficient   interest   in the voyage   
half -hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honour- 
able ambition  as that in their secret souls they would 
rather not see whales than otherwise  but all in vain

those young platonists have a notion that their vision 
is imperfect   they are short-sighted   what use  then  to 
strain the visual nerve   they have left their opera- 
glasses at home  

  why  thou monkey    said a harpooneer to one of these 
lads    we  ve been cruising now hard upon three years  
and thou hast not raised a whale yet  whales are scarce 
as hen s teeth whenever thou art up here   perhaps they 
were   or perhaps there might have been shoals of them 
in the far horizon   but lulled into such an opium-like 
listlessness of vacant  unconscious revery is this absent- 
minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with 
thoughts  that at last he loses his identity   takes the 
mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep  
blue  bottomless soul  pervading mankind and nature   
and every strange  half -seen  gliding  beautiful thing that 
eludes him   every dimly discovered  uprising fin of some 
undiscernible form  seems to him the embodiment of 
those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by con- 
tinually flitting through it  in this enchanted mood  
thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came   becomes diffused 
through time and space   like cranmer s sprinkled pan- 
theistic ashes  forming at last a part of every shore the 
round globe over  

there is no life in thee  now  except that rocking life 
imparted by a gently rolling ship   by her  borrowed from 
the sea   by the sea  from the inscrutable tides of god  
but while this sleep  this dream is on ye  move your foot 
or hand an inch   slip your hold at all   and your identity 
comes back in horror  over descartian vortices you 
hover  and perhaps  at mid-day  in the fairest weather  
with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that 
transparent air into the summer sea  no more to rise for- 
ever  heed it well  ye pantheists

the quartek-deck 

 enter ahab   then all   

it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe  that 
one morning shortly after breakfast  ahab  as was his 
wont  ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck  there 
most sea-captains usually walk at that hour  as country 
gentlemen  after the same meal  take a few turns in 
the garden  

soon his steady  ivory stride was heard  as to and fro 
he paced his old rounds  upon planks so familiar to his 
tread  that they were all over dented  like geological 
stones  with the peculiar mark of his walk  did you 
fixedly gaze  too  upon that ribbed and dented brow   
there also  you would see still stranger footprints the 
footprints of his one unsleeping  ever-pacing thought  

but on the occasion hi question  those dents looked 
deeper  even as his nervous step that morning left a 
deeper mark  and  so full of his thought was ahab  that 
at every uniform turn that he made  now at the main- 
mast and now at the binnacle  you could almost see 
that thought turn in him as he turned  and pace in him 
as he paced   so completely possessing him  indeed  
that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer 
movement  

  d  ye mark him  flask     whispered stubb     the 
chick that  s in him pecks the shell   twill soon be out   

the hours wore on   ahab now shut up within his 

199

cabin   anon  pacing the deck  with the same intense 
bigotry of purpose in his aspect  

it drew near the close of day  suddenly he came to a 
halt by the bulwarks  and inserting his bone leg into the 
auger-hole there  and with one hand grasping a shroud  
he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft  

  sir     said the mate  astonished at an order seldom 
or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary 
case  

  send everybody aft   repeated ahab    mast-heads  
there   come down     

when the entire ship s company were assembled  and 
with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were 
eyeing him  for he looked not unlike the weather horizon 
when a storm is coming up  ahab  after rapidly glancing 
over the bulwarks  and then darting his eyes among the 
crew  started from his standpoint   and as though not a 
soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the 
deck  with bent head and half-slouched hat he con- 
tinued to pace  unmindful of the wondering whispering 
among the men   till stubb cautiously whispered to 
flask  that ahab must have summoned them there for 
the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat  but this 
did not last long  vehemently pausing  he cried   

  what do ye do when ye see a whale  men     

  sing out for him     was the impulsive rejoinder from 
a score of clubbed voices  

4 good     cried ahab  with a wild approval in his tones   
observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected 
question had so magnetically thrown them  

  and what do ye next  men     

  lower away  and after him     

  and what tune is it ye pull to  men     

  a dead whale or a stove boat     

more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approv- 



the quarter-deck 201 

ing grew the countenance of the old man at every 
shout   while the mariners began to gaze curiously at 
each other  as if marvelling how it was that they them- 
selves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless 
questions  

but  they were all eagerness again  as ahab  now half- 
revolving in his pivot -hole  with one hand reaching high 
up a shroud  and tightly  almost convulsively grasping 
it  addressed them thus   

  all ye mast-headers have before now heard me give 
orders about a white whale  look ye   d  ye see this 
spanish ounce of gold     holding up a broad bright 
coin to the sun   it is a sixteen-dollar piece  men  d  ye 
see it   mr  starbuck  hand me yon top-maul  

while the mate was getting the hammer  ahab  without 
speaking  was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the 
skirts of his jacket  as if to heighten its lustre  and without 
using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to him- 
self  producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticu- 
late that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels 
of his vitality in him  

receiving the top-maul from starbuck  he advanced 
toward the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one 
hand  exhibiting the gold with the other  and with a high 
raised voice exclaiming     whosoever of ye raises me a 
white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked 
jaw   whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale  
with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke look 
ye  whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale  
he shall have this gold ounce  my boys     

  huzza   huzza     cried the seamen  as with swinging 
tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to 
the mast  

  it  s a white whale  i say   resumed ahab  as he threw 
down the top-maul     a white whale  skin your eyes 



202 moby-dick 

for him  men   look sharp for white water   if ye see but 
a bubble  sing out   

all this while tashtego  daggoo  and queequeg had 
looked on with even more intense interest and surprise 
than the rest  and at the mention of the wrinkled brow 
and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately 
touched by some specific recollection  

  captain ahab   said tashtego    that white whale must 
be the same that some call moby-dick   

  moby-dick     shouted ahab    do ye know the white 
whale then  tash     

  does he fan-tail a little curious  sir  before he goes 
down     said the gay-header deliberately  

  and has he a curious spout  too   said daggoo    very 
bushy  even for a parmacetty  and mighty quick  captain 
ahab     

1 and he have one  two  tree oh   good many iron 
in him hide  too  captain   cried queequeg disjointedly  

4 all twiske-tee be-twisk  like him him   faltering 

hard for a word  and screwing his hand round and round 
as though uncorking a bottle   like him him   

  cork-screw     cried ahab    ay  queequeg  the har- 
poons lie all twisted and wrenched in him   ay  daggoo  
his spout is a big one  like a whole shock of wheat  and 
white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great 
annual sheep-shearing   ay  tashtego  and he fan-tails 
like a split jib in a squall  death and devils   men  it is 
moby-dick ye have seen moby-dick moby-dick     

  captain ahab   said starbuck  who  with stubb and 
flask  had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing 
surprise  but at last seemed struck with a thought which 
somewhat explained all the wonder    captain ahab  
i have heard of moby-dick but it was not moby-dick 
that took off thy leg     

  who told thee that     cried ahab   then pausing  



the quarter-deck 203 

  ay  starbuck   ay  my hearties all round   it was 
moby-dick that dismasted me   moby-dick that brought 
me to this dead stump i stand on now  ay  ay   he 
shouted  with a terrific  loud  animal sob  like that of a 
heart -stricken moose     ay  ay   it was that accursed 
white whale that razeed me   made a poor pegging lubber 
of me for ever and a day     then tossing both arms  
with measureless imprecations he shouted out     ay  
ay   and i  11 chase him round good hope  and round 
the horn  and round the norway maelstrom  and round 
perdition s flames before i give him up  and this is what 
ye have shipped for  men   to chase that white whale on 
both sides of land  and over all sides of earth  till he spouts 
black blood and rolls fin out  what say ye  men  will ye 
splice hands on it  now   i think ye do look brave  

  ay  ay     shouted the harpooneers and seamen  
running closer to the excited old man     a sharp eye for 
the white whale   a sharp lance for moby-dick     

  god bless ye   he seemed to half sob and half shout  
  god bless ye  men  steward   go draw the great 
measure of grog  but what  s this long face about  mr  
starbuck   wilt thou not chase the white whale   art not 
game for moby-dick     

  i am game for his crooked jaw  and for the jaws of 
death too  captain ahab  if it fairly comes in the way of 
the business we follow   but i came here to hunt whales  
not my commander s vengeance  how many barrels 
will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it  
captain ahab   it will not fetch thee much in our nan- 
tucket market   

  nantucket market   hoot   but come closer  star- 
buck   thou requirest a little lower layer  if money  s 
to be the measurer  man  and the accountants have com- 
puted their great counting-house the globe  by girdling 
it with guineas  one to every three parts of an inch   then  



204 moby-dick 

let me tell thee  that my vengeance will fetch a great 
premium here     

  he smites his chest  whispered stubb    what  s that 
for   methinks it rings most vast  but hollow   

  vengeance on a dumb brute     cried starbuck    that 
simply smote thee from blindest instinct   madness   
to be enraged with a dumb thing  captain ahab  seems 
  blapkemous   

  hark ye yet again  the little lower layer  all visible 
objects  man  are but as pasteboard masks  but in each 
event in the living act  the undoubted deed there  some 
unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings 
of its features from behind the unreasoning mask  if man 
will strike  strike through the mask   how can the prisoner 
reach outside except by thrusting through the wall   to 
me  the white whale is that wall  shoved near to me  
sometimes i think there  s naught beyond  but  tis 
enough  he tasks me   he heaps me   i see in him out- 
rageous strength  with an inscrutable malice sinewing it  
that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate   and be the 
white whale agent  or be the white whale principal  i will 
wreak that hate upon him  talk not to me of blasphemy  
man   i  d strike the sun if it insulted me  for could the 
sun do that  then could i do the other   since there is ever 
a sort of fair play herein  jealousy presiding over all 
creations  but not my master  man  is even that fair 
play  who  s over me   truth hath no confines  take 
off thine eye   more intolerable than fiends  glarings is a 
doltish stare   so  so   thou reddenest and palest   my 
heat has melted thee to anger-glow  but look ye  star- 
buck  what is said in heat  that thing unsays itself  there 
are men from whom warm words are small indignity  i 
meant not to incense thee  let it go  look   see yonder 
turkish cheeks of spotted tawn living  breathing pictures 
painted by the sun  the pagan leopards the unrecking

and un worshipping things  that live   and seek  and give 
no reasons for the torrid life they feel   the crew  man  
the crew   are they not one and all with ahab  in this 
matter of the whale   see stubb   he laughs   see 
yonder chilian   he snorts to think of it  stand up amid 
the general hurricane  thy one tost sapling cannot  star- 
buck   and what is it   reckon it   tis but to help 
strike a fin   no wondrous feat for starbuck  what is it 
more   from this one poor hunt  then  the best lance 
out of all nantucket  surely he will not hang back  when 
every foremast -hand has clutched a whetstone   ah   
constrainings seize thee   i see   the billow lifts thee   
speak  but speak   ay  ay   thy silence  then  that 
voices thee   aside  something shot from my dilated 
nostrils  he has inhaled it in his lungs  starbuck now is 
mine   cannot oppose me now  without rebellion   

4 god keep me   keep us all     murmured starbuck 
lowly  

but in his joy at the enchanted  tacit acquiescence of the 
mate  ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation   nor 
yet the low laugh from the hold   nor yet the presaging 
vibrations of the winds in the cordage   nor yet the hollow 
flap of the sails against the masts  as for a moment their 
hearts sank in  for again starbuck s downcast eyes 
lighted up with the stubbornness of life   the subterranean 
laugh died away   the winds blew on   the sails filled out   
the ship heaved and rolled as before  ah  ye admoni- 
tions and warnings   why stay ye not when ye come   
but rather are ye predictions than warnings  ye shadows   
yet not so much predictions from without  as verifications 
of the foregoing things within  for with little external 
to constrain us  the innermost necessities in our being  
these still drive us on  

  the measure   the measure     cried ahab  

receiving the brimming pewter  and turning to the

harpooneers  he ordered them to produce their weapons  
then ranging them before him near the capstan  with 
their harpoons in their hands  while his three mates stood 
at his side with their lances  and the rest of the ship s 
company formed a circle round the group   he stood for 
an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew  
but those wild eyes met his  as the bloodshot eyes of the 
prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader  ere he rushes 
on at their head in the trail of the bison   but  alas   only 
to fall into the hidden snare of the indian

extended arm  he grasped the three level  radiating lances 
at their crossed centre   while so doing  suddenly and 
nervously twitched them   meanwhile  glancing intently 
from starbuck to stubb  from stubb to flask  it 
seemed as though  by some nameless  interior volition

he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery 
emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own 
magnetic life  the three mates quailed before his strong  
sustained  and mystic aspect  stubb and flask looked 
sideways from him   the honest eye of starbuck fell 
downright  

  in vain     cried ahab     but  maybe   tis well  for 
did ye three but once take the full-forced shock  then 
mine own electric thing  that had perhaps expired from 
out me  perchance  too  it would have dropped ye dead  
perchance ye need it not  down lances   and now  ye

silently obeying the order  the three harpooneers now 
stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons  some 
three feet long  held  barbs up  before him

brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from 
the pewter

dick to his death     the long  barbed steel goblets were 
lifted   and to cries and maledictions against the white 
whale  the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with 
a hiss  starbuck paled  and turned  and shivered  once 
more  and finally  the replenished pewter went the rounds 
among the frantic crew   when  waving his free hand to

chapter xli 

moby-dick 

i  ishmael  was one of that crew   my shouts had gone 
up with the rest   my oath had been welded with theirs   
and stronger i shouted  and more did i hammer and clinch 
my oath  because of the dread in my soul  a wild  
mystical  sympathetical feeling was in me   ahab s 
quenchless feud seemed mine  with greedy ears i 
learned the history of that murderous monster against 
whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of violence 
and revenge  

for some time past  though at intervals only  the un- 
accompanied  secluded white whale had haunted those 
uncivilised seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale 
fishermen  but not all of them knew of his existence   
only a few of them  comparatively  had knowingly seen 
him   while the number who as yet had actually and 
knowingly given battle to him  was small indeed  for  
owing to the large number of whale-cruisers   the dis- 
orderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery 
circumference  many of them adventurously pushing 
their quest along solitary latitudes  so as seldom or never 
for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch  to en- 
counter a single news-telling sail of any sort   the inordin- 
ate length of each separate voyage   the irregularity of the 
times of sailing from home   all these  with other circum- 
stances  direct and indirect  long obstructed the spread 
through the whole world- wide whaling-fleet of the special 
individualising tidings concerning moby-dick  it was 

222 



moby-dick 223 

hardly to be doubted  that several vessels reported to have 
encountered  at such or such a time  or on such or such a 
meridian  a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and 
malignity  which whale  after doing great mischief to his 
assailants  had completely escaped them   to some minds 
it was not an  unfair presumption  i say  that the whale 
in question must have been no other than moby-dick  
yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked 
by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity  
cunning  and malice in the monster attacked   therefore 
it was  that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle 
to moby-dick   such hunters  perhaps  for the most part  
were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred  more  
as it were  to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at 
large  than to the individual cause  in that way  mostly  
the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale 
had hitherto been popularly regarded  

and as for those who  previously hearing of the white 
whale  by chance caught sight of him   in the beginning 
of the thing they had every one of them  almost  as boldly 
and fearlessly lowered for him  as for any other whale of 
that species  but at length  such calamities did ensue 
in these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and 
ankles  broken limbs  or devouring amputations but 
fatal to the last degree of fatality   those repeated disas- 
trous repulses  all accumulating and piling their terrors 
upon moby -dick   those things had gone far to shake the 
fortitude of many brave hunters  to whom the story of 
the white whale had eventually come  

nor did wild rumours of all sorts fail to exaggerate  and 
still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly 
encounters  for not only do fabulous rumours naturally 
grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events  
as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi   but  in 
maritime life  far more than in that of terra-firma  wild 



224 moby-dick 

rumours abound  wherever there is any adequate reality 
for them to cling to  and as the sea surpasses the land 
in this matter  so the whale-fishery surpasses every other 
sort of maritime life  in the wonderfulness and fearful- 
ness of the rumours which sometimes circulate there  
for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that 
ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors   
but of all sailors  they are by all odds the most directly 
brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonish- 
ing in the sea   face to face they not only eye its greatest 
marvels  but  hand to jaw  give battle to them  alone  
in such remotest waters  that though you sailed a thousand 
miles  and passed a thousand shores  you would not come 
to any chiselled hearthstone  or aught hospitable beneath 
that part of the sun   in such latitudes and longitudes  
pursuing too such a calling as he does  the whaleman is 
wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy 
pregnant with many a mighty birth  

no wonder  then  that ever gathering volume from the 
mere transit over the wildest watery spaces  the outblown 
rumours of the white whale did in the end incorporate 
with themselves all manner of morbid hints  and half- 
formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies  which 
eventually invested moby-dick with new terrors un- 
borrowed from anything that visibly appears  so that in 
many cases such a panic did he finally strike  that few 
who by those rumours  at least  had heard of the white 
whale  few of those hunters were willing to encounter the 
perils of his jaw  

but there were still other and more vital practical 
influences at work  not even at the present day has the 
original prestige of the sperm whale  as fearfully dis- 
tinguished from all other species of the leviathan  died out 
of the minds of the whalemen as a body  there are those 
this day among them  who  though intelligent and cour- 



moby-dick 225 

ageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right 
whale  would perhaps  either from professional inexperi- 
ence  or incompetency  or timidity  decline a contest with 
the sperm whale   at any rate  there are plenty of whale- 
men  especially among those whaling nations not sailing 
under the american flag  who have never hostilely en- 
countered the sperm whale  but whose sole knowledge 
of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster 
primitively pursued in the north   seated on their 
hatches  these men will hearken with a childish fireside 
interest and awe  to the wild  strange tales of southern 
whaling  nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the 
great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly compre- 
hended  than on board of those prows which stem him  

and as if the now tested reality of his might had in 
former legendary times thrown its shadow before it   we 
find some book naturalists olassen and povelson 
declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation 
to every other creature in the sea  but also to be so in- 
credibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human   
blood  nor even down to so late a time as cuvier s  were 
these or almost similar impressions effaced  for in his 
natural history  the baron himself affirms that at 
sight of the sperm whale  all fish  sharks included  are 
 struck with the most lively terrors   and  often in the 
precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the 
rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death   
and however the general experiences in the fishery may 
amend such reports as these   yet in their full terribleness  
even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson  the super- 
stitious belief in them is  in some vicissitudes of their 
vocation  revived in the minds of the hunters  

so that overawed by the rumours and portents concern- 
ing him  not a few of the fishermen recalled  in reference 
to moby-dick  the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery  

vol  i  p 



226 moby-dick 

when it was oftentimes hard to induce long -practised right 
whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring 
warfare   such men protesting that although other 
leviathans might be hopefully pursued  yet to chase and 
point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was 
not for mortal man  that to attempt it  would be inevit- 
ably to be torn into a quick eternity  on this head  
there are some remarkable documents that may be 
consulted  

nevertheless  some there were  who even in the face of 
these things were ready to give chase to moby-dick   and 
a still greater number who  chancing only to hear of him 
distantly and vaguely  without the specific details of any 
certain calamity  and without superstitious accompani- 
ments  were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle 
if offered  

one of the wild suggestings referred to  as at last coming 
to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the 
superstitiously inclined  was the unearthly conceit that 
moby-dick was ubiquitous   that he had actually been 
encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same 
instant of time  

nor  credulous as such minds must have been  was 
this conceit altogether without some faint show of super- 
stitious probability  for as the secrets of the currents 
in the seas have never yet been divulged  even to the 
most erudite research   so the hidden ways of the sperm 
whale when beneath the surface remain  in great part  
unaccountable to his pursuers   and from time to time 
have originated the most curious and contradictory specu- 
lations regarding them  especially concerning the mystic 
modes whereby  after sounding to a great depth  he trans- 
ports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely 
distant points  

it is a thing well known to both american and english 



moby-dick 227 

whale-ships  and as well a thing placed upon authoritative 
record years ago by scoresby  that some whales have been 
captured far north in the pacific  in whose bodies have been 
found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas  
nor is it to be gainsaid  that in some of these instances it 
has been declared that the interval of time between the 
two assaults could not have exceeded very many days  
hence  by inference  it has been believed by some whale- 
men  that the nor - west passage  so long a problem to 
man  was never a problem to the whale  so that here  
in the real living experience of living men  the prodigies 
related in old times of the inland strello mountain in 
portugal  near whose top there was said to be a lake in 
which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface    
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa 
fountain near syracuse  whose waters were believed to 
have come from the holy land by an underground 
passage    these fabulous narrations are almost fully 
equalled by the realities of the whaleman  

forced into familiarity  then  with such prodigies as 
these   and knowing that after repeated  intrepid assaults  
the white whale had escaped alive   it cannot be much 
matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still 
further in their superstitions   declaring moby-dick not 
only ubiquitous  but immortal  for immortality is but 
ubiquity in time    that though groves of spears should 
be planted in his flanks  he would still swim away un- 
harmed   or if indeed he should ever be made to spout 
thick blood  such a sight would be but a ghastly decep- 
tion   for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of 
leagues away  his unsullied jet would once more be seen  

but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings  
there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable 
character of the monster to strike the imagination with 
unwonted power  for  it was not so much his uncommon 



228 moby-dick 

bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm 
whales  but  as was elsewhere thrown out a peculiar 
snow-white wrinkled forehead  and a high  pyramidical 
white hump  these were his prominent features   the 
tokens whereby  even hi the limitless  uncharted seas  
he revealed his identity  at a long distance  to those who 
knew him  

the rest of his body was so streaked  and spotted  and 
marbled with the same shrouded hue  that  in the end  
he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white 
whale   a name  indeed  literally justified by his vivid 
aspect  when seen gliding at high noon through a dark 
blue sea  leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam  all 
spangled with golden gleamings  

nor was it his unwonted magnitude  nor his remarkable 
hue  nor yet his deformed lower jaw  that so much in- 
vested the whale with natural terror  as that unexampled  
intelligent malignity which  according to specific accounts  
he had over and over again evinced in his assaults  more 
than all  his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay 
than perhaps aught else  for  when swimming before 
his exulting pursuers  with every apparent symptom of 
alarm  he had several times been known to turn round 
suddenly  and  bearing down upon them  either stave 
their boats to splinters  or drive them back in consterna- 
tion to their ship  

already several fatalities had attended his chase  
but though similar disasters  however little bruited 
ashore  were by no means unusual in the fishery   yet  in 
most instances  such seemed the white whale s infernal 
aforethought of ferocity  that every dismembering or 
death that he caused  was not wholly regarded as having 
been inflicted by an unintelligent agent  

judge  then  to what pitches of inflamed  distracted 
fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were im- 



moby-dick 229 

pelled  when amid the chips of chewed boats  and the 
sinking limbs of torn comrades  they swam out of the 
white curds of the whale s direful wrath into the serene  
exasperating sunlight  that smiled on  as if at a birth or 
a bridal  

his three boats stove around him  and oars and men 
both whirling in the eddies  one captain  seizing the line- 
knife from his broken prow  had dashed at the whale  
as an arkansas duellist at his foe  blindly seeking with a 
six-inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale  
that captain was ahab  and then it was  that suddenly 
sweeping his sickle -shaped lower jaw beneath him  moby- 
dick had reaped away ahab s leg  as a mower a blade of 
grass in the field  no turbaned turk  no hired venetian 
or malay  could have smote him with more seeming 
malice  small reason was there to doubt  then  that ever 
since that almost fatal encounter  ahab had cherished a 
wild vindictiveness against the whale  all the more fell 
for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to 
identify with him  not only all his bodily woes  but all 
his intellectual and spiritual exasperations  the white 
whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation 
of all those malicious agencies which some deep men 
feel eating in them  till they are left living on with half 
a heart and half a lung  that intangible malignity which 
has been from the beginning   to whose dominion even 
the modern christians ascribe one-half of the worlds   
which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their 
statue devil   ahab did not fall down and worship it 
like them   but deliriously transferring its idea to the 
abhorred white whale  he pitted himself  all mutilated  
against it  all that most maddens and torments   all 
that stirs up the lees of things   all truth with malice in 
it   all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain   all 
the subtle demonisms of life and thought   all evil  to

crazy ahab  were visibly personified  and made practically 
assailable in moby-dick  he piled upon the whale s 
white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt 
by his whole race from adam down   and then  as if his 
chest had been a mortar  he burst his hot heart s shell 
upon it  

it is not probable that this monomania in him took its 
instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismember- 
ment  then  in darting at the monster  knife in hand  
he had but given loose to a sudden  passionate  corporal 
animosity   and when he received the stroke that tore 
him  he probably but felt the agonising bodily laceration  
but nothing more  yet  when by this collision forced to 
turn toward home  and for long months of days and weeks  
ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one ham- 
mock  rounding in mid- winter that dreary  howling pata- 
gonian cape   then it was  that his torn body and gashed 
soul bled into one another   and so interfusing  made him 
mad  that it was only then  on the homeward voyage  
after the encounter  that the final monomania seized him  
seems all but certain from the fact that  at intervals during 
the passage  he was a raving lunatic   and  though un- 
limbed of a leg  yet such vital strength yet lurked in his 
egyptian chest  and was moreover intensified by his 
delirium  that his mates were forced to lace him fast  
even there  as he sailed  raving in his hammock  in a 
strait -jacket  he swung to the mad rockings of the gales  
and  when running into more sufferable latitudes  the 
ship  with mild stun  -sails spread  floated across the 
tranquil tropics  and  to all appearances  the old man s 
delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn 
swells  and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed 
light and air   even then  when he bore that firm  collected 
front  however pale  and issued his calm orders once again   
and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now 



moby-dick 231 

gone   even then  ahab  in his hidden self  raved on  
human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline 
thing  when you think it fled  it may have but become 
transfigured into some still subtler form  ahab s full 
lunacy subsided not  but deepeningly contracted   like 
the unabated hudson  when that noble northman flows 
narrowly  but unfathomably through the highland gorge  
but  as in his narrow-flowing monomania  not one jot 
of ahab s broad madness had been left behind   so in 
that broad madness  not one jot of his great natural 
intellect had perished  that before living agent  now 
became the living instrument  if such a furious trope 
may stand  his special lunacy stormed his general sanity  
and carried it  and turned all its concentrated cannon 
upon its own mad mark   so that far from having lost 
his strength  ahab  to that one end  did now possess a 
thousand-fold more potency than ever he had sanely 
brought to bear upon any one reasonable object  

this is much   yet ahab s larger  darker  deeper part 
remains unhinted  but vain to popularise profundities  
and all truth is profound  winding far down from within 
the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we 
here stand however grand and wonderful  now quit it   
and take your way  ye nobler  sadder souls  to those vast 
roman halls of thermes   where far beneath the fantastic 
towers of man s upper earth  his root of grandeur  his 
whole awful essence sits in bearded state   an antique 
buried beneath antiquities  and throned on torsoes   
so with a broken throne  the great gods mock that captive 
king   so like a caryatid  he patient sits  upholding on 
his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages  wind ye 
down there  ye prouder  sadder souls   question that 
proud  sad king   a family likeness   ay  he did beget 
ye  ye young exiled royalties   and from your grim sire 
only will the old state -secret come

now  in his heart  ahab had some glimpse of this  
namely   all my means are sane  my motive and my object 
mad  yet without power to kill  or change  or shun the 
fact  he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dis- 
  semble   in some sort  did still  but that thing of his 
dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility  not 
to his will determinate  nevertheless  so well did he 
succeed in that dissembling  that when with ivory leg 
he stepped ashore at last  no nantucketer thought him 
otherwise than but naturally grieved  and that to the 
quick  with the terrible casualty which had overtaken 
him  

the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was like- 
wise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause  and so too  
all the added moodiness which always afterward  to the 
very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage  
sat brooding on his brow  nor is it so very unlikely  
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling 
voyage  on account of such dark symptoms  the calculating 
people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbour the 
conceit  that for those very reasons he was all the better 
qualified and set on edge  for a pursuit so full of rage and 
wildness as the bloody hunt of whales  gnawed within 
and scorched without  with the unfixed  unrelenting fangs 
of some incurable idea   such an one  could he be found  
would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his 
lance against the most appalling of all brutes  or  if for 
any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for 
that  yet such an one would seem superlatively competent 
to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack  but 
be all this as it may  certain it is  that with the mad 
secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him  
ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with 
the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the white 
whale  had any one of his old acquaintances on shore

but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then  how 
soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched 
the ship from such a fiendish man   they were bent 
on profitable cruises  the profit to be counted down in 
dollars from the mint  he was intent on an audacious  
immitigable  and supernatural revenge  

here  then  was this gray-headed  ungodly old man  
chasing with curses a job s whale round the world  at the 
head of a crew  too  chiefly made up of mongrel renegades  
and castaways  and cannibals morally enfeebled  also  
by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right- 
mindedness mstarbuck  the invulnerable jollity of indiffer- 
ence and recklessness in stubb  and the pervading medioc- 
rity in flask  such a crew  so officered  seemed specially 
picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help mm 
to his monomaniac revenge  how it was that they so 
aboundingly responded to the old man s ire by what 
evil magic their souls were possessed  that at times his 
hate seemed almost theirs   the white whale as much 
their insufferable foe as his   how all this came to be- 
what the white whale was to them  or how to their 
unconscious understandings  also  in some dim  unsus- 
pected way  he might have seemed the gliding great demon 
of the seas of life  all this to explain  would be to dive 
deeper than ishmael can go  the subterranean miner 
that works in us all  how can one tell whither leads his 
shaft by the ever shifting  muffled sound of his pick   
who does not feel the irresistible arm drag   what skiff 
in tow of a seventy-four can stand still   for one  i gave 
myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place   
but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale  could see 
naught in that brute but the deadliest ill  



chapter xlii 

the whiteness of the whale 

what the white whale was to ahab has been hinted   
what  at times  he was to me  as yet remains unsaid  

aside from those more obvious considerations touching 
moby-dick  which could not but occasionally awaken in 
any man s soul some alarm  there was another thought  
or rather vague  nameless horror concerning him  which 
at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the 
rest   and yet so mystical and well-nigh ineffable was it  
that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible 
form  it was the whiteness of the whale that above all 
things appalled me  but how can i hope to explain 
myself here   and yet  in some dim  random way  explain 
myself i must  else all these chapters might be naught  

though in many natural objects  whiteness refiningly 
enhances beauty  as if imparting some special virtue of 
its own  as in marbles  japonicas  and pearls   and though 
various nations have in some way recognised a certain 
royal pre-eminence in this hue   even the barbaric  grand 
old kings of pegu placing the title   lord of the white 
elephants   above all their other magniloquent ascrip- 
tions of dominion   and the modern kings of siam un- 
furling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal 
standard   and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure 
of a snow-white charger   and the great austrian empire  
caesarian  heir to overlording rome  having for the 
imperial colour the same imperial hue   and though this 
pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself  giving 

234 



the whiteness of the whale 235 

the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe   
and though  besides all this  whiteness has been even 
made significant of gladness  for among the romans a 
white stone marked a joyful day   and though in other 
mortal sympathies and symbolisings  this same hue is 
made the emblem of many touching  noble things the 
innocence of brides  the benignity of age   though among 
the bed men of america the giving of the white belt of 
wampum was the deepest pledge of honour   though in 
many climes  whiteness typifies the majesty of justice 
in the ermine of the judge  and contributes to the daily 
state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds   
though even in the higher mysteries of the most august 
religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spot- 
lessness and power   by the persian fire -worshippers  the 
white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar   
and in the greek mythologies  great jove himself being 
made incarnate in a snow-white bull   and though to the 
noble iroquois  the mid-winter sacrifice of the sacred 
white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology  
that spotless  faithful creature being held the purest 
envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual 
tidings of their own fidelity   and though directly from 
the latin word for white  all christian priests derive the 
name of one part of their sacred vesture  the alb or tunic  
worn beneath the cassock   and though among the holy 
pomps of the romish faith  white is specially employed 
in the celebration of the passion of our lord   though 
in the vision of st  john  white robes are given to the 
redeemed  and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed 
in white before the great white throne  and the holy 
one that sitteth there white like wool   yet for all these 
accumulated associations  with whatever is sweet  and 
honourable  and sublime  there yet lurks an elusive some- 
thing in the innermost idea of this hue  which strikes more 



  



236 moby-dick 

of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in 
blood  

this elusive quality it is  which causes the thought of 
whiteness  when divorced from more kindly associations  
and coupled with any object terrible in itself  to heighten 
that terror to the furthest bounds  witness the white 
bear of the poles  and the white shark of the tropics   
what but their smooth  flaky whiteness makes them the 
transcendent horrors they are   that ghastly whiteness 
it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness  even more 
loathsome than terrific  to the dumb gloating of their 
aspect  so that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic 
coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear 
or shark  1 

bethink thee of the albatross  whence come those 
clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread  in which 
that white phantom sails in all imaginations   not 
coleridge first threw that spell   but god s great  unflatter- 
ing laureate  nature  2 

1 with reference to the polar bear  it may possibly be urged by him 
who would fain go still deeper into this matter  that it is not the white- 
ness  separately regarded  which heightens the intolerable hideousness of 
that brute   for  analysed  that heightened hideousness  it might be said  
only arises from the circumstance  that the irresponsible ferociousness of 
the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love   
and hence  by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds  
the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast  but even 
assuming all this to be true   yet  were it not for the whiteness  you 
would not have that intensified terror  

as for the white shark  the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that 
creature  when beheld in his ordinary moods  strangely tallies with the 
same quality in the polar quadruped  this peculiarity is most vividly 
hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish  the romish 
mass for the dead begins with   requiem eternam    eternal rest   whence 
requiem denominating the mass itself  and any other funereal music  
now  in allusion to the white  silent stillness of death in this shark  and 
the mild deadliness of his habits  the french call him requin  

2 i remember the first albatross i ever saw  it was during a prolonged 
gale  in waters hard upon the antarctic seas  from my forenoon watch 
below  i ascended to the overclouded deck   and there  dashed upon the 
main hatches  i saw a regal  feathery thing of unspotted whiteness  and 
with a hooked  roman bill sublime  at intervals  it arched forth its vast

most famous in our western annals and indian tradi- 
tions is that of the white steed of the prairies   a 
magnificent milk-white charger  large -eyed  small-headed  
bluff-chested  and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs 
in his lofty  over-scorning carriage  he was the elected 
xerxes of vast herds of wild horses  whose pastures in 
those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains 
and the alleghanies  at their flaming head he westward 
trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads 
on the hosts of light  the flashing cascade of his mane  
the curving comet of his tail  invested him with housings 
more resplendent than gold and silver beaters could have 
furnished him  a most imperial and archangelical appari- 
tion of that unf alien  western world  which to the eyes of 



archangel wings  as if to embrace some holy ark  wondrous flutterings 
and throbbings shook it  though bodily unharmed  it uttered cries  as 
some king s ghost in supernatural distress  through its inexpressible  
strange eyes  methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god  as 



strange eyes  metnougnt l peeped to secrets wnicn toofc hold 01 l od  as i 
abraham before the angels  i bowed myself   the white thing was so white  1 
its wings so wide  and in those forever exiled waters  i had lost the   
miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns  long i gazed at 
that prodigy of plumage  i cannot tell  can only hint  the things that 
darted through me then  but at last i awoke   and turning  asked a 
sailor what bird was this  a goney  he replied  goney   i never had 
heard that name before   is it conceivable that this glorious thing ia 
utterly unknown to men ashore   never   but some time after  i learned 
that goney was some seaman s name for albatross  so that by no possi- 
bility could coleridge s wild rhyme have had aught to do with those 
mystical impressions which were mine  when i saw that bird upon our 
deck  for neither had i then read the rhyme  nor knew the bird to be 
an albatross  yet  in saying this  i do but indirectly burnish a little 
brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet  

i assert  then  that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly 
lurks the secret of the spell   a truth the more evinced in this  that by a 
solecism of terms there are birds called gray albatrosses   and these i have 
frequently seen  but never with such emotions as when i beheld the 
antarctic fowl  

but how had the mystic thing been caught  whisper it not  and i 
will tell   with a treacherous hook and line  as the fowl floated on the sea  
at last the captain made a postman of it   tying a lettered  leathern tally 
round its neck  with the ship s time and place   and then letting it 
escape  but i doubt not  that leathern tally  meant for man  was taken 
off in heaven  when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding  the 
invoking  and adoring cherubim

the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those 
primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god  
bluff -bo wed and fearless as this mighty steed  whether 
marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of 
countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the 
plains  like an ohio   or whether with his circumambient 
subjects browsing all around at the horizon  the white 
steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils 
reddening through his cool milkiness   in whatever aspect 
he presented himself  always to the bravest indians he 
was the object of trembling reverence and awe  nor can 
it be questioned from what stands on legendary record 
of this noble horse  that it was his spiritual whiteness 
chiefly  which so clothed him with divineness   and that 
this divineness had that in it which  though commanding 
worship  at the same time enforced a certain nameless 
terror  

but there are other instances where this whiteness loses 
all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in 
the white steed and albatross  

what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels 
and often shocks the eye  as that sometimes he is loathed 
by his own kith and kin   it is that whiteness which 
invests him  a thing expressed by the name he bears  
the albino is as well made as other men has no sub- 
stantive deformity and yet this mere aspect of all- 
pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous 
than the ugliest abortion  why should this be so   

nor  in quite other aspects  does nature in her least 
palpable but not the less malicious agencies  fail to enlist 
among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible  
from its snowy aspect  the gauntleted ghost of the 
southern seas has been denominated the white squall  
nor  in some historic instances  has the art of human 
malice omitted so potent an auxiliary  how wildly it 



the whiteness of the whale 239 

heightens the effect of that passage in froissart  when  
masked in the snowy symbol of their faction  the desper- 
ate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the 
market-place   

nor  in some things  does the common  hereditary 
experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the 
supernaturalism of this hue  it cannot well be doubted  
that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which 
most appals the gazer  is the marble pallor lingering there   
as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of 
consternation in the other world  as of mortal trepidation 
here  and from that pallor of the dead  we borrow the 
expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them  
nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same 
snowy mantle round our phantoms   all ghosts rising in 
a milk-white fog yea  while these terrors seize us  let 
us add  that even the king of terrors  when personified by 
the evangelist  rides on his pallid horse  

therefore  in his other moods  symbolise whatever 
grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness  no man can 
deny that in its profoundest idealised significance it calls 
up a peculiar apparition to the soul  

but though without dissent this point be fixed  how is 
mortal man to account for it   to analyse it would 
seem impossible  can we  then  by the citation of some 
of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness 
though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped 
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught 
fearful  but  nevertheless  is found to exert over us the 
same sorcery  however modified   can we thus hope to 
light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden 
cause we seek   

let us try  but in a matter like this  subtlety appeals 
to subtlety  and without imagination no man can follow 
another into these halls  and though  doubtless  some at 



240 moby-dick 

least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented 
may have been shared by most men  yet few perhaps were 
entirely conscious of them at the time  and therefore may 
not be able to recall them now  

why to the man of untutored ideality  who happens to 
be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of 
the day  does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal 
in the fancy such long  dreary  speechless processions of 
slow-pacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with new- 
fallen snow   or  to the unread  unsophisticated protes- 
tant of the middle american states  why does the passing 
mention of a white friar or a white nun  evoke such an 
eyeless statue in the soul   

or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned 
warriors and kings  which will not wholly account for it  
that makes the white tower of london tell so much more 
strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american 
than those other storied structures  its neighbours the 
byward tower  or even the bloody   and those sub- 
limer towers  the white mountains of new hampshire  
whence  in peculiar moods  comes that gigantic ghostli- 
ness over the soul at the bare mention of that name  while 
the thought of virginia s blue ridge is full of a soft  dewy  
distant dreaminess   or  why  irrespective of all latitudes 
and longitudes  does thg name of the white sea exert 
such a spectralness over the fancy  while that of the 
yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered 
mild afternoons on the waves  followed by the gaudiest 
and yet sleepiest of sunsets   or  to choose a wholly un- 
substantial instance  purely addressed to the fancy  why  
in reading the old fairy tales of central europe  does   the 
tall pale man   of the hartz forests  whose changeless 
pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves 
why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping 
imps of the blocksburg   



the whiteness of the whale 241 

nor is it  altogether  the remembrance of her cathedral- 
toppling earthquakes   nor the stampedoes of her frantic 
seas   nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain   
nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires  wrenched 
cope-stones  and crosses all adroop  like canted yards of 
anchored fleets    and her suburban avenues of house- 
walls lying over upon each other  as a tossed pack of 
cards   it is not these things alone which make tearless 
lima the strangest  saddest city thou canst see  for 
lima has taken the white veil   and there is a higher 
horror in this whiteness of her woe  old as pizarro  
this whiteness keeps her ruins forever new   admits not 
the cheerful greenness of complete decay   spreads over 
her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that 
fixes its own distortions  

i know that  to the common apprehension  this phe- 
nomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime 
agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise 
terrible   nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught 
of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another 
mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon  
especially when exhibited under any form at all approach- 
ing to muteness or universality  what i mean by these 
two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated 
by the following examples  

first   the mariner  when drawing nigh the coasts of 
foreign lands  if by night he hear the roar of breakers  
starts to vigilance  and feels just enough of trepidation to 
sharpen all his faculties   but under precisely similar 
circumstances  let him be called from his hammock to 
view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky 
whiteness as if from encircling headlands shoals of 
combed white bears were swimming round him then he 
feels a silent  superstitious dread   the shrouded phantom 
of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost

in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings   heart 
and helm they both go down   he never rests till blue 
water is under him again  yet where is the mariner who 
will tell thee    sir  it was not so much the fear of striking 
hidden rocks  as the fear of that hideous whiteness that 
so stirred me     

second   to the native indian of peru  the continual 
sight of the snow-howdahed andes conveys naught of 
dread  except  perhaps  in the mere fancying of the eternal 
frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes  and 
the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to 
lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes  much the same 
is it with the backwoodsman of the west  who with com- 
parative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted 
with driven snow  no shadow of tree or twig to break the 
fixed trance of whiteness  not so the sailor  beholding 
the scenery of the antarctic seas   where at times  by 
some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost 
and air  he  shivering and half shipwrecked  instead of 
rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery  views 
what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him 
with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses

about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven 
soul   thou surrenderest to a hypo  ishmael

peaceful valley of vermont  far removed from all beasts 
of prey why is it that upon the sunniest day  if you but 
shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him  so that he cannot 
even see it  but only smells its wild animal muskiness 
why will he start  snort  and with bursting eyes paw the 
ground in frenzies of affright   there is no remem- 
brance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green 
northern home  so that the strange muskiness he smells 
cannot recall to him anything associated with the experi-

bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of 
the prairies  which this instant they may be trampling 
into dust  

thus  then  the muffled rollings of a milky sea   the 
bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains   the 
desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies   
all these  to ishmael  are as the shaking of that buffalo 
robe to the frightened colt   

though neither knows where lie the nameless things of 
which the mystic sign gives forth such hints   yet with s 
me  as with the colt  somewhere those things must exist  
though in many of its aspects this visible world seems 
formed in love  the invisible spheres were formed in fright  

but not yet have we solved the incantation of this 
whiteness  and learned why it appeals with such power to 
the soul   and more strange and far more portentous 
why  as we have seen  it is at once the most meaning 
symbol of spiritual things  nay  the very veil of the 
christian s deity   and yet should be as it is  the intensi- 
fying agent in things the most appalling to mankind  

is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the 
heartless voids and immensities of the universe  and thus 
stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation  
when beholding the white depths of the milky way   or 
is it  that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour 
as the visible   absence j c laar  and at the same time the 
concrete of all colours   is it for these reasons that there 
is such a dumb blankness  full of meaning  in a wide 
landscape of snows a colourless  all-colour of atheism

from which we shrink   and when we consider that other 
theory of the natural philosophers  that all other earthly 
hues every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet 
tinges of sunset skies and woods   yea  and the gilded 
velvets of butterflies  and the butterfly cheeks of young 
girls   all these are but subtle deceits  not actually in- 
herent in substances  but only laid on from without   so 
that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot  
whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house 
within   and when we proceed further  and consider 
that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of 
her hues  the great principle of light  forever remains 
white or colourless in itself  and if operating without 
medium upon matter  would touch all objects  even 
tulips and roses  with its own blank tinge pondering all 
this  the palsied universe lies before us a leper   and like 
wilful travellers in lapland  who refuse to wear coloured 
and colouring glasses upon their eyes  so the wretched 
infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white 
shroud that wraps all the prospect around him  and of 
all these things the albino whale was the symbol  wonder

of the fresh-water butts in the waist  to the scuttle-butt

the chart 

had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin 
after the squall that took place on the night succeeding 
that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew  you 
would have seen him go to a locker in the transom  and 
bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea-charts  
spread them before him on his screwed-down table  then 
seating himself before it  you would have seen him intently 
study the various lines and shadings which there met his 
eye   and with slow but steady pencil trace additional 
courses over spaces that before were blank  at intervals  
he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him  wherein 
were set down the seasons and places in which  on various 
former voyages of various ships  sperm whales had been 
captured or seen  

while thus employed  the heavy pewter lamp suspended 
foi chains over his head  continually rocked with the motion 
of the ship  and forever threw shifting gleams and shadows 
of lines upon his wrinkled brow  till it almost seemed that 
while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the 
wrinkled charts  some invisible pencil was also tracing 
lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his 
forehead  

but it was not this night in particular that  in the 
solitude of his cabin  ahab thus pondered over his charts  
almost every night they were brought out   almost every 
night some pencil marks were effaced  and others were 
substituted  for with the charts of all four oceans before

him  ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies  
with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that 
monomaniac thought of his soul  

now  to anyone not fully acquainted with the ways of 
the leviathans  it might seem an absurdly hopeless task 
thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped 
oceans of this planet  but not so did it seem to ahab  
who knew the sets of all tides and currents   and thereby 
calculating the drif tings of the sperm whale s food   and  
also  calling to mind the regular  ascertained seasons for 
hunting him in particular latitudes   could arrive at 
reasonable surmises  almost approaching to certainties  
concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that 
ground in search of his prey  

so assured  indeed  is the fact concerning the periodical- 
ness of the sperm whale s resorting to given waters  that 
many hunters believe that  could he be closely observed 
and studied throughout the world   were the logs for one 
voyage of the entire whale -fleet carefully collated  then 
the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to 
correspond in invariability to those of the herring -shoals 
or the flights of swallows  on this hint  attempts have 
been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the 
sperm whale  1 

besides  when making a passage from one feeding- 
ground to another  the sperm whales  guided by some 
infallible instinct say  rather  secret intelligence from 

1 since the above was written  the statement is happily borne out by an 
official circular  issued by lieutenant maury  of the national observatory  
washington  april 16th  1851  by that circular  it appears that precisely 
such a chart is in course of completion   and portions of it are presented 
in the circular    this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees 
of latitude by five degrees of longitude   perpendicularly through each 
of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months   and hori- 
zontally through each of which districts are three lines   one to show the 
number of days that have been spent in each month in every district  and 
the two others to show the number of days in which whales  sperm or 
right  have been seen

the deity mostly swim in veins  as they are called   con- 
tinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such 
undeviating exactitude  that no ship ever sailed her 
course  by any chart  with one tithe of such marvellous 
precision  though  in these cases  the direction taken 
by any one whale be straight as a surveyor s parallel  and 
though the line of advance be strictly confined to its 
own unavoidable  straight wake  yet the arbitrary vein 
in which at these times he is said to swim  generally 
embraces some few miles in width  more or less  as the 
vein is presumed to expand or contract    but never 
exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship s mast- 
heads  when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone  
the sum is  that at particular seasons within that breadth 
and along that path  migrating whales may with great 
confidence be looked for  

and hence not only at substantiated times  upon well- 
known separate feeding-grounds  could ahab hope to 
encounter his prey   but in crossing the widest expanses 
of water between those grounds he could  by his art  so 
place and time himself on his way  as even then not to be 
wholly without prospect of a meeting  

there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to 
entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme  but 
not so in reality  perhaps  though the gregarious sperm 
whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds  
yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which 
haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year  
say  will turn out to be identically the same with those 
that were found there the preceding season   though 
there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where 
the contrary of this has proved true  in general  the same 
remark  only within a less wide limit  applies to the soli- 
taries and hermits among the matured  aged sperm whales  
so that though moby-dick had in a former year been seen  



250 moby-dick 

for example  on what is called the seychelle ground in the 
indian ocean  or volcano bay on the japanese coast   
yet it did not follow  that were the pequod to visit either 
of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season  
she would infallibly encounter him there  so  too  with 
some other feeding -grounds  where he had at times 
revealed himself  but all these seemed only his casual 
stopping-places and ocean-inns  so to speak  not his places 
of prolonged abode  and where ahab s chances of 
accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of  
allusion has only been made to whatever wayside  ante- 
cedent  extra prospects were his  ere a particular set time 
or place were attained  when all possibilities would become 
probabilities  and  as ahab fondly thought  every possi- 
bility the next thing to a certainty  that particular set 
time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase 
the season-on-the-line  for there and then  for 
several consecutive years  moby-dick had been periodic- 
ally descried  lingering in those waters for a while  as the 
sun  in its annual round  loiters for a predicted interval 
in any one sign of the zodiac  there it was  too  that 
most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had 
taken place   there the waves were storied with his deeds   
there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old 
man had found the awful motive to his vengeance  but 
in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigi- 
lance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this 
unfaltering hunt  he would not permit himself to rest all 
his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned  
however flattering it might be to those hopes   nor in the 
sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillise his unquiet 
heart as to postpone all intervening quest  

now  the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very 
beginning of the season-on-the-line  no possible en- 
deavour then could enable her commander to make the 



the chart 251 

great passage southward  double cape horn  and then 
running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the 
equatorial pacific in time to cruise there  therefore  he 
must wait for the next ensuing season  yet the prema- 
ture hour of the pequod s sailing had  perhaps  been 
correctly selected by ahab  with a view to this very com- 
plexion of things  because  an interval of three hundred 
and sixty-five days and nights was before him   an inter- 
val which  instead of impatiently enduring ashore  he 
would spend in a miscellaneous hunt   if by chance the 
white whale  spending his vacation in seas far remote 
from his periodical feeding-grounds  should turn up his 
wrinkled brow off the persian gulf  or in the bengal bay  
or china seas  or in any other waters haunted by his race  
so that monsoons  pampas  nor -westers  harmattans  
trades   any wind but the levanter and simoom  might 
blow moby-dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of 
the pequod s circumnavigating wake  

but granting all this   yet  regarded discreetly and 
coolly  seems it not but a mad idea  this   that in the broad 
boundless ocean  one solitary whale  even if encountered  
should be thought capable of individual recognition from 
his hunter  even as a white-bearded mufti in the thronged 
thoroughfares of constantinople   yes  for the peculiar 
snow-white brow of moby-dick  and his snow-white hump  
could not but be unmistakable  and have i not tallied 
the whale  ahab would mutter to himself  as after poring 
over his charts till long after midnight he would throw 
himself back in reveries tallied him  and shall he escape   
his broad fins are bored  and scalloped out like a lost 
sheep s ear   and here  his mad mind would run on in a 
breathless race   till a weariness and faintness of ponder- 
ing came over him   and in the open air of the deck he 
would seek to recover his strength  ah  god   what 
trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed

with one unachieved revengeful desire  he sleeps with 
clenched hands   and wakes with his own bloody nails in 
his palms  

often  when forced from his hammock by exhausting 
and intolerably vivid dreams of the night  which  resuming 
his own intense thoughts through the day  carried them 
on amid a clashing of frenzies  and whirled them round 
and round in his blazing brain  till the very throbbing 
of his life-spot became insufferable anguish   and when  

was sometimes the case  these spiritual throes in him 
heaved his being up from its base  and a chasm seemed 
opening in him  from which forked flames and lightnings 
shot up  and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down 
among them   when this hell in himself yawned beneath 
him  a wild cry would be heard through the ship   and 
with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state-room  
as though escaping from a bed that was on fire  yet 
these  perhaps  instead of being the unsuppressible 
symptoms of some latent weakness  or fright at his own 
resolve  were but the plainest tokens of its intensity  for  
at such times  crazy ahab  the scheming  unappeasedly 
steadfast hunter of the white whale   this ahab that had 
gone to his hammock  was not the agent that so caused 
him to burst from it in horror again  the latter was the 
eternal  living principle or soul in him   and in sleep  being 
for the time dissociated from the characterising mind  
which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or 
agent  it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching 
contiguity of the frantic thing  of which  for the time  it 
was no longer an integral  but as the mind does not 
exist unless leagued with the soul  therefore it must have 
been that  in ahab s case  yielding up all his thoughts and 
fancies to his one supreme purpose   that purpose  by its 
own sheer inveteracy of will  forced itself against gods 
and devils into a kind of self-assumed  independent being

of its own  nay  could grimly live and burn  while the 
common vitality to which it was conjoined  fled horror- 
stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth  there- 
fore  the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes  
when what seemed ahab rushed from his room  was for 
the time but a vacated thing  a formless somnambulistic 
being  a ray of living light  to be sure  but without an 
object to colour  and therefore a blankness in itself  god 
help thee  old man  thy thoughts have created a creature 
in thee   and he whose intense thinking thus makes him 
a prometheus   a vulture feeds upon that heart forever   
that vulture the very creature he creates

the affidavit 

so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book   
and  indeed  as indirectly touching one or two very inter- 
esting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm 
whales  the foregoing chapter  in its earlier part  is as 
important a one as will be found in this volume   but 
the leading matter of it requires to be still further and 
more familiarly enlarged upon  in order to be adequately 
understood  and moreover to take away any incredulity 
which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may 
induce in some minds  as to the natural verity of the main 
points of this affair  

i care not to perform this part of my task methodically   
but shall be content to produce the desired impression by 
separate citations of items  practically or reliably known 
to me as a whaleman   and from these citations  i take 
it  the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself  

first   i have personally known three instances where 
a whale  after receiving a harpoon  has effected a complete 
escape   and  after an interval  in one instance of three 
years   has been again struck by the same hand  and slain   
when the two irons  both marked by the same private 
cipher  have been taken from the body  in the instance 
where three years intervened between the flinging of the 
two harpoons   and i think it may have been something 
more than that   the man who darted them happening  
in the interval  to go in a trading-ship on a voyage to 
africa  went ashore there  joined a discovery party  and 

254 



the affidavit 255 

penetrated far into the interior  where he travelled for a 
period of nearly two years  often endangered by serpents  
savages  tigers  poisonous miasmas  with all the other 
common perils incident to wandering in the heart of un- 
known regions  meanwhile  the whale he had struck 
must also have been on its travels   no doubt it had thrice 
circumnavigated the globe  brushing with its flanks all 
the coasts of africa   but to no purpose  this man and 
this whale again came together  and the one vanquished 
the other  i say i  myself  have known three instances 
similar to this   that is in two of them i saw the whales 
struck   and  upon the second attack  saw the two irons 
with the respective marks cut in them  afterward taken 
from the dead fish  in the three-year instance  it so fell 
out that i was in the boat both times  first and last  and 
the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge 
mole under the whale s eye  which i had observed there 
three years previous  i say three years  but i am pretty 
sure it was more than that  here are three instances  
then  which i personally know the truth of   but i have 
heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity 
in the matter there is no good ground to impeach  

secondly   it is well known in the sperm whale fishery  
however ignorant the world ashore maybe of it  that there 
have been several memorable historical instances where a 
particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times 
and places popularly cognisable  why such a whale 
became thus marked was not altogether arid originally 
owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from 
other whales   for however peculiar in that respect any 
chance whale may be  they soon put an end to his peculi- 
arities by killing him  and boiling him down into a peculi- 
arly valuable oil  no   the reason was this   that from 
the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible 
prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did 



256 moby-dick 

about rinaldo rinaldini  insomuch that most fishermen 
were content to recognise him by merely touching their 
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them 
on the sea  without seeking to cultivate a more intimate 
acquaintance  like some poor devils ashore that happen 
to know an irascible great man  they make distant unob- 
trusive salutations to him in the street  lest if they pursued 
the acquaintance further  they might receive a summary 
thump for their presumption  

but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy 
great individual celebrity nay  you may call it an ocean- 
wide renown   not only was he famous in life and now is 
immortal in forecastle stories after death  but he was 
admitted into all the rights  privileges  and distinctions 
of a name   had as much a name indeed as cambyses or 
caesar  was it not so  o timor tom   thou famed 
leviathan  scarred like an iceberg  who so long didst lurk 
in the oriental straits of that name  whose spout was oft

crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land

miguel   thou chilian whale  marked like an old tortoise

but this is not all  new zealand tom and don miguel  
after at various times creating great havoc among the 
boats of different vessels  were finally gone in quest of  
systematically hunted out  chased and killed by valiant 
whaling-captains  who heaved up their anchors with that 
express object as much in view  as in setting out through 
the narragansett woods  captain butler of old had it 



the affidavit 257 

in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage 
annawon  the headmost warrior of the indian king 
philip  

i do not know where i can find a better place than just 
here  to make mention of one or two other things  which 
to me seem important  as in printed form establishing 
in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of 
the white whale  more especially the catastrophe  for 
this is one of those disheartening instances where truth 
requires full as much bolstering as error  so ignorant 
are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most 
palpable wonders of the world  that without some hints 
touching the plain facts  historical and otherwise  of the 
fishery  they might scout at moby-dick as a monstrous 
fable  or still worse and more detestable  a hideous and 
intolerable allegory  

first   though most men have some vague flitting ideas 
of the general perils of the grand fishery  yet they have 
nothing like a fixed  vivid conception of those perils  
and the frequency with which they recur  one reason 
perhaps is  that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and 
deaths by casualties in the fishery  ever finds a public 
record at home  however transient and immediately 
forgotten that record  do you suppose that that poor 
fellow there  who this moment perhaps caught by the 
whale-line off the coast of new guinea  is being carried 
down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan 
do you suppose that that poor fellow s name will appear 
in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at 
your breakfast   no   because the mails are very 
irregular between here and new guinea  in fact  did 
you ever hear what might be called regular news direct 
or indirect from new guinea   yet i tell you that 
upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific  
among many others we spoke thirty different ships  every

one of which had had a death by a whale  some of them 
more than one  and three that had each lost a boat s crew  
for god s sake  be economical with your lamps and 
candles   not a gallon you burn  but at least one drop of 
man s blood was spilled for it  

secondly   people ashore have indeed some indefinite 
idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous 
power   but i have ever found that when narrating to 
them some specific example of this twofold enormousness  
they have significantly complimented me upon my 
facetiousness   when  i declare upon my soul  i had no 
more idea of being facetious than moses  when he wrote 
the history of the plagues of egypt  

but fortunately the special point i here seek can be 
established upon testimony entirely independent of my 
own  that point is this   the sperm whale is in some 
cases sufficiently powerful  knowing  and judiciously 
malicious  as with direct aforethought to stave in  utterly 
destroy  and sink a large ship   and what is more  the 
sperm whale has done it  

first   in the year 1820 the ship essex  captain 
pollard  of nantucket  was cruising in the pacific ocean  
one day she saw spouts  lowered her boats  and gave chase 
to a shoal of sperm whales  ere long  several of the 
whales were wounded   when  suddenly  a very large 
whale escaping from the boats  issued from the shoal  
and bore directly down upon the ship  dashing his 
forehead against her hull  he so stove her in  that in less 
than   ten minutes   she settled down and fell over  not 
a surviving plank of her has been seen since  after the 
severest exposure  part of the crew reached the land in 
their boats  being returned home at last  captain 
pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of 
another ship  but the gods shipwrecked him again upon 
unknown rocks and breakers   for the second time his 



the affidavit 259 

ship was utterly lost  and forthwith forswearing the sea  
he has never tempted it since  at this day captain pollard 
is a resident of nantucket  i have seen owen chace  
who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy   
i have read his plain and faithful narrative   i have 
conversed with his son   and all this within a few miles 
of the scene of the catastrophe  1 

secondly   the ship union  also of nantucket  was in 
the year 1 807 totally lost off the azores by a similar onset  
but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have 
never chanced to encounter  though from the whale- 
hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it  

thirdly   some eighteen or twenty years ago commo- 
dore j   then commanding an american sloop -of -war 

of the first class  happened to be dining with a party of 
whaling-captains  on board a nantucket ship in the 

1 the following are extracts from chace s narrative     every fact 
seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance 
which directed his operations   he made two several attacks upon the ship  
at a short interval between them  both of which  according to their 
direction  were calculated to do us the most injury  by being made ahead  
and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shook   to 
effect which  the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary  his 
aspect was most horrible  and such as indicated resentment and fury  he 
came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered  and in 
which we had struck three of his companions  as if fired with revenge for 
their sufferings   again     at all events  the whole circumstances taken 
together  all happening before my own eyes  and producing  at the time  
impressions in my mind of decided  calculating mischief  on the part of 
the whale  many of which impressions i cannot now recall   induce me to 
be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion   

here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship  during a 
black night in an open boat  when almost despairing of reaching any 
hospitable shore    the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing   
the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest  or dashed 
upon hidden rocks  with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful con- 
templation  seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought   the dismal- 
looking wreck  and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale  wholly 
engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance

unbelief by a similar fright   i tell you  the sperm whale 
will stand no nonsense  

i will now refer you to langsdorff  s voyages for a little 
circumstance in point  peculiarly interesting to the writer 
hereof  langsdorff  you must know by the way  was 
attached to the russian admiral krusenstern s famous dis- 
co very expedition in the beginning of the present century  
captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter  

4 by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail  
and the next day we were out in the open sea  on our way 
to ochotsh  the weather was very clear and fine  but 
so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our 
fur clothing  for some days we had very little wind   
it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the 
north-west sprang up  an uncommon large whale  the 
body of which was larger than the ship itself  lay almost 
at the surface of the water  but was not perceived by any- 
one on board till the moment when the ship  which was 
in full sail  was almost upon him  so that it was impossible 



the affidavit 261 

to prevent its striking against him  we were thus placed 
in the most imminent danger  as this gigantic creature  
setting up its back  raised the ship three feet at least out 
of the water  the masts reeled  and the sails fell alto- 
gether  while we who were below all sprang instantly 
upon the deck  concluding that we had struck upon some 
rock   instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with 
the utmost gravity and solemnity  captain d wolf 
applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether 
or not the vessel had received any damage from the 
shock  but we found that very happily it had escaped 
entirely uninjured   

now  the captain d wolf here alluded to as command- 
ing the ship in question  is a new englander  who  after 
a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain  this 
day resides in the village of dorchester near boston  i 
have the honour of being a nephew of his  i have par- 
ticularly questioned him concerning this passage in langs- 
dorfl he substantiates every word  the ship  however  
was by no means a large one   a russian craft built on 
the siberian coast  and purchased by my uncle after 
bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home  

in that up and down manly book of old-fashioned 
adventure  so full  too  of honest wonders the voyage 
of lionel wafer  one of ancient dampier s old chums 
i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted 
from langsdorff  that i cannot forbear inserting it here 
for a corroborative example  if such be needed  

lionel  it seems  was on his way to   john ferdi- 
nando   as he calls the modern juan fernandez    in 
our way thither   he says   about four o clock in the 
morning  when we were about one hundred and fifty 
leagues from the main of america  our ship felt a terrible 
shock  which put our men in such consternation that they 
could hardly tell where they were or what to think   but 



262 moby-dick 

everyone began to prepare for death  and  indeed  the 
shock was so sudden and violent  that we took it for granted 
the ship had struck against a rock   but when the amaze- 
ment was a little over  we cast the lead  and sounded  but 
found no ground        the suddenness of the 
shock made the guns leap in their carriages  and several of 
the men were shaken out of their hammocks  captain 
davis  who lay with his head on a gun  was thrown out 
of his cabin     lionel then goes on to impute the shock 
to an earthquake  and seems to substantiate the imputa- 
tion by stating that a great earthquake  somewhere about 
that time   did actually do great mischief along the spanish 
land  but i should not much wonder if  in the darkness 
of that early hour of the morning  the shock was after all 
caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull 
from beneath  

i might proceed with several more examples  one way 
or another known to me  of the great power and malice 
at times of the sperm whale  in more than one instance  
he has been known  not only to chase the assailing boats 
back to their ships  but to pursue the ship itself  and long 
withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks  
the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head   
and  as for his strength  let me say  that there have been 
examples where the lines attached to a running sperm 
whale have  in a calm  been transferred to the ship  and 
secured there   the whale towing her great hull through 
the water  as a horse walks off with a cart  again  it is 
very often observed that  if the sperm whale  once struck  
is allowed time to rally  he then acts  not so often with 
blind rage  as with wilful  deliberate designs of destruction 
to his pursuers   nor is it without conveying some elo- 
quent indication of his character  that upon being attacked 
he will frequently open his mouth  and retain it in that 
dread expansion for several consecutive minutes  but i 



the affidavit 263 

must be content with only one more and a concluding 
illustration   a remarkable and most significant one  by 
which you will not fail to see  that not only is the most 
marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain 
facts of the present day  but that these marvels  like all 
marvels  are mere repetitions of the ages   so that for 
the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily 
there is nothing new under the sun  

in the sixth christian century lived procopius  a chris- 
tian magistrate of constantinople  in the days when 
justinian was emperor and belisarius general  as many 
know  he wrote the history of his own times  a work every 
way of uncommon value  by the best authorities  he 
has always been considered a most trustworthy and un- 
exaggerating historian  except in some one or two par- 
ticulars  not at all affecting the matter presently to be 
mentioned  

now  in this history of his  procopius mentions that  
during the term of his prefecture at constantinople  a 
great sea-monster was captured in the neighbouring 
propontis  or sea of marmora  after having destroyed 
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more 
than fifty years  a fact thus set down in substantial 
history cannot easily be gainsaid  nor is there any 
reason it should be  of what precise species this sea- 
monster was  is not mentioned  but as he destroyed 
ships  as well as for other reasons  he must have been a 
whale   and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale  
and i will tell you why  for a long time i fancied that 
the sperm whale had been always unknown in the medi- 
terranean and the deep waters connecting with it  even 
now i am certain that those seas are not  and perhaps 
never can be  in the present constitution of things  a place 
for his habitual gregarious resort  but further investi- 
gations have recently proved to me  that in modern times 



264 moby-dick 

there have been isolated instances of the presence of the 
sperm whale in the mediterranean  i am told  on good 
authority  that on the barbary coast  a commodore 
davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm 
whale  now  as a vessel of war readily passes through 
the dardanelles  hence a sperm whale could  by the same 
route  pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis  
in the propontis  as far as i can learn  none of that 
peculiar substance called brit is to be found  the aliment 
of the right whale  but i have every reason to believe 
that the food of the sperm whale squid or cuttle-fish 
lurks at the bottom of that sea  because large creatures  
but by no means the largest of that sort  have been found 
at its surface  if  then  you properly put these statements 
together  and reason upon them a bit  you will clearly 
perceive that  according to all human reasoning  pro- 
copius s sea-monster  that for half a century stove the 
ships of a roman emperor  must in all probability have 
been a sperm whale

though  consumed with the hot fire of his purpose  
ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the 
ultimate capture of moby-dick   though he seemed ready 
to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion   never- 
theless it may have been that he was by nature and long 
habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s ways  
altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the 
voyage  or at least if this were otherwise  there were 
not wanting other motives much more influential with 
him  it would be refining too much  perhaps  even con- 
sidering his monomania  to hint that his vindictiveness 
toward the white whale might have possibly extended 
itself in some degree to all sperm whales  and that the 
more monsters he slew  by so much the more he multiplied 
the chances that each subsequently encountered whale 
would prove to be the hated one he hunted  but if such 
an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable  there were still 
additional considerations which  though not so strictly 
according with the wildness of his ruling passion  yet were 
by no means incapable of swaying him  

to accomplish his object ahab must use tools   and 
of all tools used in the shadow of the moon  men are most 
apt to get out of order  he knew  for example  that 
however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was 
over starbuck  yet that ascendency did not cover the 
complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal 
superiority involves intellectual mastership   for to the 

265 



266 moby-dick 

purely spiritual  the intellectual but stand in a sort of 
corporeal relation  starbuck s body and starbuck s 
coerced will were ahab s  so long as ahab kept his magnet 
at starbuck s brain   still he knew that for all this the 
chief mate  in his soul  abhorred his captain s quest  and 
could he  would joyfully disintegrate himself from it  
or even frustrate it  it might be that a long interval 
would elapse ere the white whale was seen  during that 
long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open 
relapses of rebellion against his captain s leadership  
unless some ordinary  prudential  circumstantial influ- 
ences were brought to bear upon him  not only that  
but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby-dick 
was no ways more significantly manifested than in his 
superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that  for 
the present  the hunt should in some way be stripped of 
that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally 
invested it   that the full terror of the voyage must be 
kept withdrawn into the obscure background  for few 
men s courage is proof against protracted meditation 
unrelieved by action    that when they stood their long 
night-watches  his officers and men must have some nearer 
things to think of than moby-dick  for however eagerly 
and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announce- 
ment of his quest   yet all sailors of all sorts are more or 
less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying 
outer weather  and they inhale its fickleness and when 
retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit  
however promissory of life and passion in the end  it is 
above all things requisite that temporary interests and 
employments should intervene and hold them healthily 
suspended for the final dash  

nor was ahab unmindful of another thing  in times of 
strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations   
but such times are evanescent  the permanent con- 



surmises 267 

stitutional condition of the manufactured man  thought 
ahab  is sordidness  granting that the white whale 
fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew  and playing 
round their savageness even breeds a certain generous 
knight -errant ism in them  still  while for the love of it 
they give chase to moby-dick  they must also have food 
for their more common  daily appetites  for even the 
high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not 
content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight 
for their holy sepulchre  without committing burglaries  
picking pockets  and gaining other pious perquisites by 
the way  had they been strictly held to their one final 
and romantic object that final and romantic object  
too many would have turned from in disgust  i will not 
strip these men  thought ahab  of all hopes of cash ay  
cash  they may scorn cash now   but let some months 
go by  and no perspective promise of it to them  and then   
this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them  
this same cash would soon cashier ahab  

nor was there wanting still another precautionary 
motive more related to ahab personally  having im- 
pulsively  it is probable  and perhaps somewhat pre- 
maturely revealed the prime but private purpose of the 
pequod s voyage  ahab was now entirely conscious that  
in so doing  he had indirectly laid himself open to the 
unanswerable charge of usurpation   and with perfect 
impunity  both moral and legal  his crew if so disposed  
and to that end competent  could refuse all further 
obedience to him  and even violently wrest from him the 
command  from even the barely hinted imputation 
of usurpation  and the possible consequences of such 
a suppressed impression gaining ground  ahab must of 
course have been most anxious to protect himself  that 
protection could only consist in his own predominating 
brain and heart and hand  backed by a heedful  closely 



268 moby-dick 

calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influ- 
ence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to  

for all these reasons then  and others perhaps too 
analytic to be verbally developed here  ahab plainly saw 
that he must still in a good degree continue true to the 
natural  nominal purpose of the pequod s voyage   observe 
all customary usages   and not only that  but force 
himself to evince all his well-known passionate interest 
in the general pursuit of his profession  

be all this as it may  his voice was now often heard 
hailing the three mast-heads and admonishing them to 
keep a bright look-out  and not omit reporting even a 
porpoise  this vigilance was not long without reward  



chapter xlvii 

the mat-maker 

it was a cloudy  sultry afternoon   the seamen were 
lazily lounging about the decks  or vacantly gazing over 
into the lead-coloured waters  queequeg and i were 
mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat  
for an additional lashing to our boat  so still and 
subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene  
and such an incantation of revelry lurked in the air  
that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own 
invisible self  

i was the attendant or page of queequeg  while busy 
at the mat  as i kept passing and repassing the filling 
or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp  
using my own hand for the shuttle  and as queequeg  
standing sideways  ever and anon slid his heavy oaken 
sword between the threads  and idly looking off upon 
the water  carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every 
yarn   i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign 
all over the ship and all over the sea  only broken by the 
intermitting dull sound of the sword  that it seemed as 
if this were the loom of time  and i myself were a shuttle 
mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates  
there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one 
single  ever returning  unchanging vibration  and that 
vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise inter- 
blending of other threads with its own  this warp 
seemed necessity   and here  thought i  with my own hand 
i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these 

269 



270 moby-dick 

unalterable threads  meantime  queequeg s impulsive  
indifferent sword  sometimes hitting the woof slantingly  
or crookedly  or strongly  or weakly  as the case might 
be   and by this difference in the concluding blow pro- 
ducing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the 
completed fabric   this savage s sword  thought i  which 
thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof   this 
easy  indifferent sword must be chance ay  chance  free 
will  and necessity no wise incompatible all inter- 
weavingly working together  the straight warp of neces- 
sity  not to be swerved from its ultimate course its every 
  alternating vibration  indeed  only tending to that   free 
will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads   
and chance  though restrained in its play within the right 
lines of necessity  and sideways in its motions directed 
by free will  though thus prescribed to by both  chance 
by turns rules either  and has the last featuring blow at 

events  

        

thus we were weaving and weaving away when i 
i started at a soundjgq strange  long drawn  and musically 
i wild and unearthly  that the ball of free will dropped from 
my hand  and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that 
voice dropped like a wing  high aloft in the cross-trees 
was that mad gay-header  tashtego  his body was 
reaching eagerly forward  his hand stretched out like a 
wand  and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries  
to be sure  the same sound was that very moment perhaps 
being heard all over the seas  from hundreds of whale- 
men s look-outs perched as high in the air   but from 
few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have 
derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the 
indian s  

as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air  
so wildly and eagerly peering toward the horizon  you 



the mat-maker 271 

would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding 
the shadows of fate  and by those wild cries announcing 
their coming  

  there she blows   there   there   there   she blows   
she blows     

4 where away     

  on the lee-beam  about two miles off   a school of 
them     

instantly all was commotion  

the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks  with the 
same undeviating and reliable uniformity  and thereby 
whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of 
his genus  

  there go flukes     was now the cry from tashtego   
and the whales disappeared  

4 quick  steward     cried ahab    time   time     

dough-boy hurried below  glanced at the watch  and 
reported the exact minute to ahab  

the ship was now kept away from the wind  and she 
went gently rolling before it  tashtego reporting that 
the whales had gone down heading to leeward  we con- 
fidently looked to see them again directly in advance of 
our bows  for that singular craft at times evinced by 
the sperm whale when  sounding with his head in one 
direction  he nevertheless  while concealed beneath the 
surface  mills round  and swiftly swims off in the opposite 
quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in 
action   for there was no reason to suppose that the fish 
seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed  or indeed 
knew at all of our vicinity  one of the men selected for 
ship-keepers that is  those not appointed to the boats 
by this time relieved the indian at the mainmast-head  
the sailors at the fore and mizen had come down   the 
line-tubs were fixed in their places   the cranes were 
thrust out   the main-yard was backed  and the three 



272 moby-dick 

boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over 
high cliffs  outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with 
one hand clung to the rail  while one foot was expectantly 
poised on the gunwale  so look the long line of man-of- 
war s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy s 
ship  

but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was 
heard that took every eye from the whale  with a start 
all glared at dark ahab  who was surrounded by five dusky 
phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air  



chapter xlviii 

the first lowering 

the phantoms  for so they then seemed  were flitting on 
the other side of the deck  and  with a noiseless celerity  
were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which 
swung there  this boat had always been deemed one 
of the spare boats  though technically called the captain s  
on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter  
the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart  
with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like 
lips  a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally 
invested him  with wide black trowsers of the same dark 
stuff  but strangely crowning this ebonness was a 
glistening white plaited turban  the living hair braided 
and coiled round and round upon his head  less swart 
in aspect  the companions of this figure were of that vivid  
tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal 
natives of the manillas   a race notorious for a certain 
diabolism of subtlety  and by some honest white mariners 
supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential 
agents on the water of the devil  their lord  whose counting- 
room they suppose to be elsewhere  

while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing 
upon these strangers  ahab cried out to the white-turbaned 
old man at their head    all ready there  fedallah     

  ready   was the half -hissed reply  

4 lower away then   d  ye hear     shouting across the 
deck    lower away there  i say   

such was the thunder of his voice  that spite of their 

vol  i  s 



274 moby-dick 

amazement the men sprang over the rail   the sheaves 
whirled round in the blocks   with a wallow  the three 
boats dropped into the sea   while  with a dexterous  off- 
handed daring  unknown in any other vocation  the sailors  
goat-like  leaped down the rolling ship s side into the 
tossed boats below  

hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee  
when a fourth keel  coming from the windward side  
pulled round under the stern  and showed the five strangers 
rowing ahab  who  standing erect in the stern  loudly 
hailed starbuck  stubb  and flask  to spread themselves 
widely  so as to cover a large expanse of water  but with 
all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and 
his crew  the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the 
command  

  captain ahab     said starbuck  

  spread yourselves   cried ahab     give way  all four 
boats  thou  flask  pull out more to leeward     

  ay  ay  sir   cheerily cried little king-post  sweeping 
round his great steering -oar    lay back     addressing 
his crew    there   there   there again   there she 
blows right ahead  boys   lay back     

  never heed yonder yellow boys  archy   

  oh  i don t mind  em  sir   said archy     i knew it all

i tell cabaco here of it   what say ye  cabaco   they 
are stowaways  mr  flask   

  pull  pull  my fine hearts-alive   pull  my children   
pull  my little ones   drawlingly and soothingly sighed 
stubb to his crew  some of whom still showed signs of 
uneasiness    why don t you break your backbones  my 
boys   what is it you stare at   those chaps in yonder 
boat   tut   they are only five more hands come to 
help us never mind from where the more the merrier  
pull  then  do pull   never mind the brimstone devils

now ye do something   that looks like it  my steel-bits  
start her start her  my silver-spoons   start her  
marling-spikes     

stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large  
because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them 
in general  and especially in inculcating the religion of 
rowing  but you must not suppose from this specimen 
of his sermonisings that he ever flew into downright 
passions with his congregation  not at all   and therein 
consisted his chief peculiarity  he would say the most 
terrific things to his crew  in a tone so strangely com- 
pounded of fun and fury  and the fury seemed so calcu- 
lated merely as a spice to the fun  that no oarsman could 
hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear 
life  and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing  be- 
sides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself  
so loungingly managed his steering-oar  and so broadly 
gaped open-mouthed at times that the mere sight of 
such a yawning commander  by sheer force of contrast  



276 moby-dick 

acted like a charm upon the crew  then again  stubb 
was one of those odd sort of humorists  whose jollity 
is sometimes so curiously ambiguous  as to put all in- 
feriors on their guard in the matter of obeying them  

in obedience to a sign from ahab  starbuck was now 
pulling obliquely across stubb  s bow   and when for a 
minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other  
stubb hailed the mate  

4 mr  starbuck   larboard boat there  ahoy   a word 
with ye  sir  if ye please     

  halloa     returned starbuck  turning round not a 
single inch as he spoke   still earnestly but whisperingly 
urging his crew   his face set like a flint from stubb  s  

  what think ye of those yellow boys  sir     

  smuggled on board  somehow  before the ship sailed  
 strong  strong  boys      in a whisper to his crew  then 
speaking out loud again     a sad business  mr  stubb   
 seethe her  seethe her  my lads    but never mind  mr  
stubb  all for the best  let all your crew pull strong  
come what will   spring  my men  spring    there  s 
hogsheads of sperm ahead  mr  stubb  and that  s what 
ye came for   pull  my boys    sperm  sperm  s the 
play   this at least is duty   duty and profit hand in 
hand     

  ay  ay  i thought as much   soliloquised stubb  
when the boats diverged  c as soon as i clapt eye on  em  
i thought so  ay  and that  s what he went into the 
after-hold for  so often  as dough -boy long suspected  
they were hidden down there  the white whale  s at 
the bottom of it  well  well  so be it   can t be helped   
all right   give way  men   it ain t the white whale 
to-day   give way     

now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such 
a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the 
deck  this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of 



the first lowering 277 

superstitious amazement in some of the ship s company   
but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous 
got abroad among them  though indeed not credited then  
this had in some small measure prepared them for the 
event  it took off the extreme edge of their wonder   
and so what with all this and stubb s confident way of 
accounting for their appearance  they were for the time 
freed from superstitious surmisings   though the affair 
still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures 
as to dark ahab s precise agency in the matter from the 
beginning  for me  i silently recalled the mysterious 
shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during 
the dim nantucket dawn  as well as the enigmatical 
hintings of the unaccountable elijah  

meantime  ahab  out of hearing of his officers  having 
sided the furthest to windward  was still ranging ahead 
of the other boats   a circumstance bespeaking how potent 
a crew was pulling him  those tiger-yellow creatures of 
his seemed all steel and whalebone   like five trip-hammers 
they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength  which 
periodically started the boat along the water like a hori- 
zontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer  as for 
fedallah  who was seen pulling the harpooneer-oar  he 
had thrown aside his black jacket  and displayed his 
naked chest with the whole part of his body above the 
gunwale  clearly cut against the alternating depressions 
of the watery horizon   while at the other end of the boat 
ahab  with one arm  like a fencer s  thrown half backward 
into the air  as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip   
ahab was seen steadily managing his steering -oar as in a j 
thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn  
him  all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar 
motion and then remained fixed  while the boat s five oars 
were seen simultaneously peaked  boat and crew sat 
motionless on the sea  instantly the three spread boats

in the rear paused on their way  the whales had irregu- 
larly settled bodily down into the blue  thus giving no 
distantly discernible token of the movement  though 
from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it  

4 every man look out along his oars     cried starbuck  
  thou  queequeg  stand up     

nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in 
the bow  the savage stood erect there  and with intensely 
eager eyes gazed off toward the spot where the chase 
had last been descried  likewise upon the extreme stern 
of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level 
with the gunwale  starbuck himself was seen coolly and 
adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his 
chip of a craft  and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of 
the sea  

not very far distant flask s boat was also lying breath- 
lessly still   its commander recklessly standing upon the 
top of the logger-head  a stout sort of post rooted in the 
keel  and rising some two feet above the level of the stern 
platform  it is used for catching turns with the whale - 
line  its top is not more spacious than the palm of a 
man s hand  and standing upon such a base as that  flask 
seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had 
sunk to all but her trucks  but little king-post was small 
and short  and at the same time little king-post was full 
of a large and tall ambition  so that this logger-head stand- 
point of his did by no means satisfy king-post  

c i can t see three seas off   tip us up an oar there  and 
let me on to that   

upon this  daggoo  with either hand upon the gunwale   
to steady his way  swiftly slid aft  and then erecting him- 
self volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal  

  good a mast-head as any  sir  will you mount     

  that i will  and thank ye very much  my fine fellow   
only i wish you fifty feet taller   



the first lowering 279 

whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite 
planks of the boat  the gigantic negro  stooping a little  
presented his flat palm to flask s foot  and then 
putting flask s hand on his hearse-plumed head and 
bidding him spring as he himself should toss  with one 
dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on 
his shoulders  and here was flask now standing  
daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breast- 
band to lean against and steady himself by  

at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with 
what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whale- 
man will maintain an erect posture in his boat  even when 
pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross- 
running seas  still more strange to see him giddily 
perched upon the logger-head itself  under such circum- 
stances  but the sight of little flask mounted upon 
gigantic daggoo was yet more curious   for sustaining 
himself with a cool  indifferent  easy  unthought-of  
barbaric majesty  the noble negro to every roll of the sea 
harmoniously rolled his fine form  on his broad back  
flaxen-haired flask seemed a snow-flake  the bearer 
looked nobler than the rider  though truly vivacious  
tumultuous  ostentatious little flask would now and then 
stamp with impatience   but not one added heave did he 
thereby give to the negro s lordly chest  so have i seen 
passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous  
earth  but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons 
for that  

meanwhile stubb  the third mate  betrayed no such 
far-gazing solicitudes  the whales might have made 
one of their regular soundings  not a temporary dive from 
mere fright   and if that were the case  stubb  as his 
wont in such cases  it seems  was resolved to solace the 
languishing interval with his pipe  he withdrew it from 
his hat-band  where he always wore it aslant like a feather

he loaded it  and rammed home the loading with his 
thumb-end   but hardly had he ignited his match across 
the rough sandpaper of his hand  when tashtego  his 
harpooneer  whose eyes had been setting to windward like 
two fixed stars  suddenly dropped like light from his erect 
attitude to his seat  crying out in a quick frenzy of 
hurry    down  down all  and give way   there they are     

to a landsman  no whale  nor any sign of a herring  
would have been visible at that moment   nothing but a 
troubled bit of greenish-white water  and thin scattered 
puffs of vapour hovering over it  and suffusingly blowing 
off to leeward  like the confused scud from white rolling 
billows  the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled  
as it were  like the air over intensely heated plates of 
iron  beneath this atmospheric waving and curling  and 
partially beneath a thin layer of water  also  the whales 
were swimming  seen in advance of all the other indi- 
cations  the puffs of vapour they spouted  seemed their 
forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders  

all four bojits were now in keen pursuit of that one spot 
of troubled water and air  but it bade far to outstrip 
them   it flew on and on  as a mass of interblending 
bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills  

  pull  pull  my good boys   said starbuck  in the lowest 
possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men   
while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight 
ahead of the bow  almost seemed as two visible needles 
in two unerring binnacle compasses  he did not say much 
to his crew  though  nor did his crew say anything to him  
only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly 
pierced by one of his peculiar whispers  now harsh with 
command  now soft with entreaty  

how different the loud little king-post    sing out 
and say something  my hearties  roar and pull  my 
thunderbolts   beach me  beach me on their black backs

boys   only do that for me  and 1 11 sign over to you my 
martha s vineyard plantation  boys   including wife and 
children  boys  lay me on lay me on   lord  lord   
but i shall go stark  staring mad   see   see that white 
water     and so shouting  he pulled his hat from his 
head  and stamped up and down on it   then picking it 
up  flirted it far off upon the sea   and finally fell to 
rearing and plunging in the boat s stern like a crazed 
colt from the prairie  

  look at that chap now   philosophically drawled 
stubb  who  with his unlighted short pipe  mechanically 
retained between his teeth  at a short distance  followed 
after   he  s got fits  that flask has  fits   yes  give 
him fits that  s the very word pitch fits into  em  
merrily  merrily  hearts -alive  pudding for supper  you 
know   merry  s the word  pull  babes pull  sucklings 
pull  all  but what the devil are you hurrying about   
softly  softly  and steadily  my men  only pull  and keep 
pulling   nothing more  crack all your backbones  and 
bite your knives hi two that  s all  take it easy why 
don t ye take it easy  i say  and burst all your livers and 
lungs     

but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that 
tiger-yellow crew of his these were words best omitted 
here   for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical 
land  only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may 
give ear to such words  when  with tornado brow  and 
eyes of red murder  and foam-glued lips  ahab leaped 
after his prey  

meanwhile  all the boats tore on  the repeated specific 
allusions of flask to   that whale   as he called the fictitious 
monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalising 
his boat s bow with his tail these allusions of his were at 
times so vivid and lifelike  that they would cause some 
one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the 






282 moby-dick 

shoulder  but this was against all rule   for the oarsmen 
must put out their eyes  and ram a skewer through their 
necks   usage pronouncing that they must have no 
organs but ears  and no limbs but arms  in these critical 
moments  

it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe   the vast 
swells of the omnipotent sea   the surging  hollow roar 
they made  as they rolled along the eight gunwales  like 
gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green   the brief 
suspended agony of the boat  as it would tip for an 
instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves  that 
almost seemed threatening to cut it in two   the sudden 
profound dip into the watery glens and hollows   the 
keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite 
hill   the headlong  sled-like slide down its other side   
all these  with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers  
and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen  with the won- 
drous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her 
boats with outstretched sails  like a wild hen after her 
screaming brood   all this was thrilling  not the raw 
recruit  marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever- 
heat of his first battle   not the dead man s ghost en- 
countering the first unknown phantom in the other world   
neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions 
than that man does  who for the first time finds himself 
pulling into the charmed  churned circle of the hunted 
sperm whale  

the dancing white water made by the chase was now 
becoming more and more visible  owing to the increasing 
darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea  
the jets of vapour no longer blended  but tilted every- 
where to right and left   the whales seemed separating 
their wakes  the boats were pulled more apart   star- 
buck giving chase to three whales running dead to lee- 
ward  our sail was now set  and  with the still rising 



the first lowering 283 

wind  we rushed along   the boat going with such madness 
through the water  that the lee -oars could scarcely be 
worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the 
rowlocks  

soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of 
mist   neither ship nor boat to be seen  

4 give way  men   whispered starbuck  drawing still 
further aft the sheet of his sail     there is time to kill a 
fish yet before the squall comes  there  s white water 
again   close to   spring     

soon after  two cries in quick succession on each side 
of us denoted that the other boats had got fast   but 
hardly were they overheard  when with a lightning-like 
hurtling whisper starbuck said     stand up     and quee- 
queg  harpoon in hand  sprang to his feet  

though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the 
life and death peril so close to them ahead  yet with their 
eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern 
of the boat  they knew that the imminent instant had 
come   they heard  too  an enormous wallowing sound 
as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter  meanwhile 
the boat was still booming through the mist  the waves 
curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of 
enraged serpents  

  that  s his hump  there  there  give it to him     
whispered starbuck  

a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat   it was 
the darted iron of queequeg  then all in one welded 
commotion came an invisible push from astern  while 
forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge   the sail 
collapsed and exploded   a gush of scalding vapour shot 
up near by   something rolled and tumbled like an earth- 
quake beneath us  the whole crew were half suffocated 
as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling 
cream of the squall  squall  whale  and harpoon had all 



284 moby-dick 

blended together   and the whale  merely grazed by the 
iron  escaped  

though completely swamped  the boat was nearly 
unharmed  swimming round it we picked up the floating 
oars  and lashing them across the gunwale  tumbled back 
to our places  there we sat up to our knees in the sea  
the water covering every rib and plank  so that to our 
downward-gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral 
boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean  

the wind increased to a howl   the waves dashed their 
bucklers together   the whole squall roared  forked  and 
crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie  in 
which  unconsumed  we were burning   immortal in these 
jaws of death   in vain we hailed the other boats   as 
well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming 
furnace as hail those boats in that storm  meanwhile 
the driving scud  rack  and mist grew darker with the 
shadows of night   no sign of the ship could be seen  
the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat  
the oars were useless as propellers  performing now the 
office of life-preservers  so  cutting the lashing of the 
waterproof match keg  after many failures starbuck 
contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern   then stretch- 
ing it on a waif -pole  handed it to queequeg as the standard- 
bearer of this forlorn hope  there  then  he sat  holding 
up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty 
forlornness  there  then  he sat  the sign and symbol 
of a man without faith  hopelessly holding up hope in 
the midst of despair  

wet  drenched through  and shivering cold  despairing 
of ship or boat  we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on  
the mist still spread over the sea  the empty lantern lay 
crushed in the bottom of the boat  suddenly queequeg 
started to his feet  hollowing his hand to his ear  we all 
heard a faint creaking  as of ropes and yards hitherto 



the first lowering 285 

muffled by the storm  the sound came nearer and 
nearer   the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge  
vague form  affrighted  we all sprang into the sea as 
the ship at last loomed into view  bearing right down upon 
us within a distance of not much more than its length  

floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat  as 
for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship s 
bows like a chip at the base of a cataract   and then the 
vast hull rolled over it  and it was seen no more till it 
came up weltering astern  again we swam for it  were 
dashed against it by the seas  and were at last taken up 
and safely landed on board  ere the squall came close 
to  the other boats had cut loose from their fish and 
returned to the ship in good time  the ship had given us 
up  but was still cruising  if haply it might light upon some 
token of our perishing  an oar or a lance pole  



chapter xl1x 

the hyena 

there are certain queer times and occasions in this 
strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this 
whole universe for a vast practical joke  though the wit 
thereof he but dimly discerns  and more than suspects 
that the joke is at nobody s expense but his own  how- 
ever  nothing dispirits  and nothing seems worth while 
disputing  he bolts down all events  all creeds  and 
beliefs  and persuasions  all hard things visible and in- 
visible  never mind how knobby   as an ostrich of potent 
digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints  and as 
for small difficulties and worryings  prospects of sudden 
disaster  peril of life and limb   all these  and death itself  
seem to him only sly  good-natured hits  and jolly punches 
in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable 
old joker  that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking 
of  comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribu- 
lation   it comes in the very midst of his earnestness  so 
that what just before might have seemed to him a thing 
most momentous  now seems but a part of the general 
joke  there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed 
this free-and-easy sort of genial  desperado philosophy   
and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the 
pequod  and the great white whale its object  

  queequeg  said i  when they had dragged me  the 
 ast man  to the deck  and i was still shaking myself in 
my jacket to fling off the water     queequeg  my fine 
friend  does this sort of thing often happen     without 

286 



the hyena 287 

much emotion  though soaked through just like me  he 
gave me to understand that such things did often happen  

4 mr  stubb   said i  turning to that worthy  who  
buttoned up in his oil-jacket  was now calmly smoking 
his pipe in the rain     mr  stubb  i think i have heard you 
say that of all whalemen you ever met  our chief mate  
mr  starbuck  is by far the most careful and prudent  i 
suppose then  that going plump on a flying whale with your 
sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman s 
discretion     

1 certain  i  ve lowered for whales from a leaking 
ship in a gale off cape horn   

4 mr  flask   said i  turning to little king-post  who was 
standing close by     you are experienced in these things  
and i am not  will you tell me whether it is an unalter- 
able law in this fishery  mr  flask  for an oarsman to break 
his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death s 
jaws     

  can t you twist that smaller     said flask    yes  
that  s the law  i should like to see a boat s crew backing 
water up to a whale face foremost  ha  ha   the whale 
would give them squint for squint  mind that   j 

here then  from three impartial witnesses  i had a 
deliberate statement of the entire case  considering  
therefore  that squalls and capsizings in the water and 
consequent bivouacks on the deep  were matters of 
common -occurrence in this kind of life   considering that 
at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the 
whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who 
steered the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very 
moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling 
the craft with his own frantic stampings   considering 
that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was 
chiefly to be imputed to starbuck s driving on to his whale 
almost in the teeth of a squall  and considering that 



288 moby-dick 

starbuck  notwithstanding  was famous for his great 
heedfulness in the fishery   considering that i belonged to 
this uncommonly prudent starbuck  s boat   and finally 
considering in what a devil s chase i was implicated  
touching the white whale   taking all things together  i 
say  i thought i might as well go below and make a rough 
draft of my will    queequeg   said i    come along  you 
shall be my lawyer  executor  and legatee  

it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be 
tinkering at their last wills and testaments  but there are 
no people in the world more fond of that diversion  this 
was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done 
the same thing  after the ceremony was concluded upon 
the present occasion  i felt all the easier   a stone was 
rolled away from my heart  besides  all the days i should 
now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived 
after his resurrection   a supplementary clean gain of so 
many months or weeks as the case might be  i survived 
myself   my death and burial were locked up in my chest  
i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly  like a quiet 
ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a 
snug family vault  

now then  thought i  unconsciously rolling up the 
sleeves of my frock  here goes for a cool  collected dive 
at death and destruction  and the devil fetch the hindmost

arab s boat and crew  fedallah 

  who would have thought it  flask     cried stubb    if 
i had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat  unless 
maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe  oh   
he  s a wonderful old man     

  i don t think it so strange  after all  on that account   
said flask    if his leg were off at the hip  now  it would 
be a different thing  that would disable him   but he 
has one knee  and good part of the other left  you know   

  i don t know that  my little man   i never yet saw 

him kneel   

        

among whale -wise people it has often been argued 
whether  considering the paramount importance of his 
life to the success of the voyage  it is right for a whaling- 
captain to jeopardise that life in the active perils of the 
chase  so tamerlane s soldiers often argued with tears 
in their eyes  whether that invaluable life of his ought to 
be carried into the thickest of the fight  

but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect  
considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling 
wight in all times of danger   considering that the pursuit 
of whales is always under great and extraordinary diffi- 
culties   that every individual moment  indeed  then 
comprises a peril   under these circumstances is it wise 
for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt   
as a general thing  the joint-owners of the pequod must 
have plainly thought not  

vol  i  t 



290 moby-dick 

ahab well knew that although his friends at home 
would think little of his entering a boat in certain com- 
paratively harmless vicissitudes of the chase  for the sake 
of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in 
person  yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually 
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt 
above all  for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra 
men  as that same boat s crew  he well knew that such 
generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners 
of the pequod  therefore he had not solicited a boat s 
crew from them  nor had he in any way hinted his desires 
on that head  nevertheless he had taken private measure 
of his own touching all that matter  until cabaco s 
published discovery  the sailors had little foreseen it  
though to be sure when  after being a little while out of 
port  all hands had concluded the customary business of 
fitting the whale-boats for service   when some time after 
this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in 
the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for 
what was thought to be one of the spare boats  and even 
solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers  which 
when the line is running out are pinned over the groove 
in the bow   when all this was observed in him  and par- 
ticularly his solicitude hi having an extra coat of sheath- 
ing in the bottom of the boat  as if to make it better 
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb   and 
also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh - 
board  or clumsy cleat  as it is sometimes called  the hori- 
zontal piece in the boat s bow for bracing the knee against 
in darting or stabbing at the whale   when it was observed 
how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee 
fixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat  and 
with the carpenter s chisel gouged out a little here and 
straightened it a little there   all these things  i say  had 
awakened much interest and curiosity at the time  but 



fedallah 291 

almost everybody supposed that this particular prepara- 
tive heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the 
ultimate chase of moby-dick   for he had already revealed 
his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person  but 
such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest 
suspicion as to any boat s crew being assigned to that 
boat  

now  with the subordinate phantoms  what wonder 
remained soon waned away   for in a whaler wonders soon 
wane  besides  now and then such unaccountable odds 
and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown 
nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating 
outlaws of whalers   and the ships themselves often pick 
up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about 
the open sea on planks  bits of wreck  oars  whale-boats  
canoes  blown-off japanese junks  and what not   that 
beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down 
into the cabin to chat with the captain  and it would not 
create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle  

but be all this as it may  certain it is that while the 
subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the 
crew  though still as it were somehow distinct from them  
yet that hair-turbaned fedallah remained a muffled 
mystery to the last  whence he came in a mannerly 
world like this  by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon 
evinced himself to be linked with ahab s peculiar fortunes  
nay  so far as to have some sort of a half -hinted influence   
heaven knows  but it might have been even authority 
over him   all this none knew  but one cannot sustain an 
indifferent air concerning fedallah  he was such a 
creature as civilised  domestic people in the temperate 
zone only see in their dreams  and that but dimly   but 
the like of whom now and then glide among the unchang- 
ing asiatic communities  especially the oriental isles to 
the east of the continent those insulated  immemorial

unalterable countries  which even in these modern days 
still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth s 
primal generations  when the memory of the first man was 
a distinct recollection  and all men his descendants  un- 
knowing whence he came  eyed each other as real phan- 
toms  and asked of the sun and the moon why they were 
created and to what end   when though  according to 
genesis  the angels indeed consorted with the daughters 
of men  the devils also  add the uncanonical rabbins  
indulged in mundane amours

the spirit- spout 

days  weeks passed  and under easy sail  the ivory pequod 
had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds   
that off the azores   off the cape de verdes   on the 
plate  so called   being off the mouth of the bio de la 
plata   and the carrol ground  an unstaked  watery 
locality  southerly from st  helena  

it was while gliding through these latter waters that 
one serene and moonlight night  when all the waves rolled 
by like scrolls of silver   and  by their soft  suffusing 
seethings  made what seemed a silvery silence  not a 
solitude   on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far    
in advance of the white bubbles at the bow  lit up by i 
the moon  it looked celestial   seemed some plumed and 
glittering god uprising from the sea  fedallah first 
descried this jet  for of these moonlight nights  it was 
his wont to mount to the mainmast-head  and stand a 
look-out there  with the same precision as if it had been 
day  and yet  though herds of whales were seen by 
night  not one whalemen in a hundred would venture a 
lowering for them  you may think with what emotions  
then  the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft 
at such unusual hours   his turban and the moon  com- 
panions in one sky  but when  after spending his uniform 
interval there for several successive nights without utter- 
ing a single sound   when  after all this silence  his un- 
earthly voice was heard announcing that silvery  moon-lit 
jet  every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some 

293 



294 moby-dick 

winged spirit had lighted in the rigging  and hailed the 
mortal crew    there she blows     had the trump of 
judgment blown  they could not have quivered more   yet 
still they felt no terror   rather pleasure  for though it 
was a most unwonted hour  yet so impressive was the cry  
and so deliriously exciting  that almost every soul on 
board instinctively desired a lowering  

walking the deck with quick  side -lunging strides  
ahab commanded the t  -gallant-sails and royals to be set  
and every stun  -sail spread  the best man in the ship 
must take the helm  then  with every mast-head manned  
the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind  the 
strange  upheaving  lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze 
filling the hollows of so many sails  made the buoyant  
hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet   while 
still she rushed along  as if two antagonistic influences 
were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven  1 
the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal  h 
and had you watched ahab s face that night  you would 
have thought that in him also two different things were 
warring  while his one live leg made lively echoes along 
the deck  every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a 
coffin-tap  on life and death this old man walked  but 
though the ship so swiftly sped  and though from every 
eye  like arrows  the eager glances shot  yet the silvery 
jet was no more seen that night  every sailor swore 
he saw it once  but not a second time  

this midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten 
thing  when  some days after  lo   at the same silent hour  
it was again announced   again it was descried by all   
but upon making sail to overtake it  once more it dis- 
appeared as if it had never been  and so it served us 
night after night  till no one heeded it but to wonder at 
it  mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight  or 
starlight  as the case might be   disappearing again for 



the spirit-spout 295 

one whole day  or two days  or three   and somehow 
seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still 
further and further in our van  this solitary jet seemed 
forever alluring us on  

nor with the immemorial superstition of their race  
and in accordance with the preternaturalness  as it seemed  
which in many things invested the pequod  were there 
wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever 
and wherever descried   at however remote times  or in 
however far apart latitudes and longitudes  that unnear- 
able spout was cast by one self-same whale   and that 
whale  moby-dick  for a time  there reigned  too  a 
sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition  as if it 
were treacherously beckoning us on and on  in order that 
the monster might turn round upon us  and rend us at 
last in the remotest and most savage seas  

these temporary apprehensions  so vague but so awful  
derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity 
of the weather  in which  beneath all its blue blandness  
some thought there lurked a devilish charm  as for days 
and days we voyaged along  through seas so wearily  
lonesomely mild  that all space  in repugnance to our 
vengeful errand  seemed vacating itself of life before our 
urn-like prow  

but  at last  when turning to the eastward  the cape 
winds began howling around us  and we rose and fell upon 
the long  troubled seas that are there   when the ivory- 
tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast  and gored the 
dark waves in her madness  till  like showers of silver 
chips  the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks   then all 
this desolate vacuity of life went away  but gave place 
to sights more dismal than before  

close to our bows  strange forms in the water darted 
hither and thither before us   while thick in our rear flew 
the inscrutable sea-ravens  and every morning  perched 



296 moby-dick 

on our stays  rows of these birds were seen   and spite 
of our hootings  for a long time obstinately clung to the 
hemp  as though they deemed our ship some drifting  
uninhabited craft   a thing appointed to desolation  and 
therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves  and 
heaved and heaved  still unrestingly heaved the black 
sea  as if its vast tides were a conscience   and the great 
mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long 
sin and suffering it had bred  

cape of good hope  do they call ye   rather cape 
tormentoto  as called of yore   for long allured by the 
perfidious silences that before had attended us  we found 
ourselves launched into this tormented sea  where guilty 
beings transformed into those fowls and these fish  
seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any 
haven in store  or beat that black air without any horizon  
but calm  snow-white  and unvarying   still directing 
its fountain of feathers to the sky   still beckoning us on 
from before  the solitary jet would at times be descried  

during all this blackness of the elements  ahab  though 
assuming for the time the almost continual command 
of the drenched and dangerous deck  manifested the 
gloomiest reserve   and more seldom than ever addressed 
his mates  in tempestuous times like these  after every- 
thing above and aloft has been secured  nothing more 
can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale  
then captain and crew become practical fatalists  so  
with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole  and 
with one hand firmly grasping a shroud  ahab for hours 
and hours would stand gazing dead to windward  while an 
occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal 
his very eyelashes together  meantime  the crew driven 
from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas 
that burstingly broke over its bows  stood in a line along 
the bulwarks in the waist   and the better to guard against 



the spirit-spout 297 

the leaping waves  each man had slipped himself into a 
sort of bow-line secured to the rail  in which he swung as 
in a loosened belt  few or no words were spoken   and 
the silent ship  as if manned by painted sailors in wax  
day after day tore on through all the swift madness and 
gladness of the demoniac waves  by night the same 
muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean 
prevailed   still in silence the men swung in the bow-lines   
still wordless ahab stood up to the blast  even when 
wearied nature seemed demanding repose  he would not 
seek that repose in his hammock  never could starbuck 
forget the old man s aspect  when one night going down 
into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood  he saw 
him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed 
chair   the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from 
which he had some time before emerged  still slowly 
dripping from the unremoved hat and coat  on the table 
beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and 
currents which have previously been spoken of  his 
lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand  though 
the body was erect  the head was thrown back so that the 
closed eyes were pointed toward the needle of the tell- 
tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling  1 

terrible old man   thought starbuck with a shudder  
sleeping in this gale  still thou steadfastly eyest thy 
purpose  

1 the cabin-compass is called the tell-tale  because  without going to 
the compass at the helm  the captain  while below  can inform himself of 
the course of the ship

the albatross 

south-eastward from the cape  off the distant crozetts  
a good cruising -ground for right whalemen  a sail loomed 
ahead  the goney  albatross  by name  as she slowly 
drew nigh  from my lofty perch at the foremast -head  i 
had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in 
the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea  and long absent 
from home  

as if the waves had been fullers  this craft was bleached 
like the skeleton of a stranded walrus  all down her 
sides  this spectral appearance was traced with long 
channels of reddened rust  while all her spars and her 
rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over 
with hoar-frost  only her lower sails were set  a wild 
sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those 
three mast-heads  they seemed clad in the skins of beasts  
so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived 
nearly four years of cruising  standing in iron hoops 
nailed to the mast  they swayed and swung over a fathom- 
less sea   and though  when the ship slowly glided close 
under our stern  we six men in the air came so nigh to each 
other that we might almost have leaped from the mast- 
heads of one ship to those of the other   yet  those for- 
lorn-looking fishermen  mildly eyeing us as they passed  
said not one word to our own look-outs  while the quarter- 
deck hail was being heard from below  

  ship ahoy   have ye seen the white whale     
but as the strange captain  leaning over the pallid 



the albatross 299 

bulwarks  was in the act of putting his trumpet to his 
mouth  it somehow fell from his hand into the sea   and 
the wind now rising amain  he in vain strove to make 
himself heard without it  meantime  his ship was still 
increasing the distance between  while in various silent 
ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observ- 
ance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention 
of the white whale s name to another ship  ahab for a 
moment paused   it almost seemed as though he would 
have lowered a boat to board the stranger  had not the 
threatening wind forbade  but taking advantage of his 
windward position  he again seized his trumpet  and 
knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a 
nantucketer and shortly bound home  he loudly hailed 
  ahoy there   this is the pequod  bound round the 
world   tell them to address all future letters to the 
pacific ocean   and this time three years  if i am not at 
home  tell them to address them to   

at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed  and 
instantly  then  in accordance with their singular ways  
shoals of small harmless fish  that for some days before 
had been placidly swimming by our side  darted away 
with what seemed shuddering fins  and ranged themselves 
fore and aft with the stranger s flanks  though in the 
course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before 
have noticed a similar sight  yet  to any monomaniac 
man  the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings  

  swim away from me  do ye     murmured ahab  
gazing over into the water  there seemed but little in 
the words  but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless 
sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced  
but turning to the steersman  who thus far had been 
holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway  
he cried out in his old lion voice    up helm   keep her 
off round the world

round the world   there is much in that sound to 
inspire proud feelings   but whereto does all that circum- 
navigation conduct   only through numberless perils 
to the very point whence we started  where those that we 
left behind secure  were all the time before us  

were this world an endless plain  and by sailing east- 
ward we could forever reach new distances  and discover 
sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands 
of king solomon  then there were promise in the voyage  
but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of  or in 
tormented chase of that demon phantom that  some time 
or other  swims before all human hearts   while chasing 
such over this round globe  they either lead us on in 
barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed  



chapter liii 

the gam 

the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the 
whaler we had spoken was this   the wind and sea be- 
tokened storms  but even had this not been the case  
he would not after all  perhaps  have boarded her judging 
by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if so it 
had been that  by the process of hailing  he had obtained 
a negative answer to the question he put  for  as it 
eventually turned out  he cared not to consort  even for 
five minutes  with any stranger captain  except he could 
contribute some of that information he so absorbingly 
sought  but all this might remain inadequately esti- 
mated  were not something said here of the peculiar usages 
of whaling-vessels wlfen meeting each other in foreign 
seas  and especially on a common cruising-ground  

if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york 
state  or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england   
if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable 
wilds  these twain  for the life of them  cannot well avoid 
a mutual salutation   and stopping for a moment to 
interchange the news   and  perhaps  sitting down for a 
while and resting in concert   then  how much more natural 
that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains 
of the sea  two whaling-vessels descrying each other at the 
ends of the earth off lone fanning  s island  or the far 
away king s mills   how much more natural  i say  
that under such circumstances these ships should not only 
interchange hails  but come into still closer  more friendly 
and sociable contact  and especially would this seem to 

901 



302 moby-dick 

be a matter of course  in the case of vessels owned in one 
seaport  and whose captains  officers  and not a few of the 
men are personally known to each other   and consequently  
have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about  

for the long absent ship  the outward-bounder  per- 
haps  has letters on board   at any rate  she will be sure 
to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later 
than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files  
and in return for that courtesy  the outward-bound ship 
would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the 
cruising-ground to which she may be destined  a thing of 
the utmost importance to her  and in degree  all this 
will hold true concerning whaling-vessels crossing each 
other s track on the cruising-ground itself  even though 
they are equally long absent from home  for one of them 
may have received a transfer of letters from some third  
and now far remote vessel   and some of those letters 
may be for the people of the ship she now meets  besides  
they would exchange the whaling news  and have an 
agreeable chat  for not only would they meet with all 
the sympathies of sailors  but likewise with all the peculiar 
congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually 
shared privations and perils  

nor would difference of country make any very essential 
difference   that is  so long as both parties speak one lan- 
guage  as is the case with americans and english  
though  to be sure  from the small number of english 
whalers  such meetings do not very often occur  and when 
they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness 
between them   for your englishman is rather reserved  
and your yankee  he does not fancy that sort of thing 
in anybody but himself  besides  the english whalers 
sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over 
the american whalers   regarding the long  lean nan- 
tucketer  with his nondescript provincialisms  as a sort 
of sea-peasant  but where this superiority in the english 



the gam 303 

whalemen does really consist  it would be hard to say  
seeing that the yankees in one day  collectively  kill more 
whales than all the english  collectively  in ten years  
but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale- 
hunters  which the nantucketer does not take much to 
heart   probably  because he knows that he has a few 
foibles himself  

so  then  we see that of all ships separately sailing the 
sea  the whalers have most reason to be sociable and 
they are so  whereas  some merchant ships crossing 
each other s wake in the mid- atlantic  will oftentimes 
pass on without so much as a single word of recognition  
mutually cutting each other on the high seas  like a brace 
of dandies in broadway   and all the time indulging  
perhaps  in finical criticism upon each other s rig  as 
for men-of-war  when they chance to meet at sea  they 
first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings  
such a ducking of ensigns  that there does not seem to be 
much right-down hearty goodwill and brotherly love 
about it at all  as touching slave-ships meeting  why  they 
are in such a prodigious hurry  they run away from each 
other as soon as possible  and as for pirates  when they 
chance to cross each other s cross-bones  the first hail is  
  how many skulls     the same way that whalers hail 
  how many barrels     and that question once answered  
pirates straightway steer apart  for they are infernal 
villains on both sides  and don t like to see overmuch of 
each other s villainous likenesses  

but look at the godly  honest  unostentatious  hos- 
pitable  sociable  free-and-easy whaler   what does the 
whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of 
decent weather   she has a   gam   a thing so utterly 
unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the 
name even   and if by chance they should hear of it  they 
only grin at it  and repeat gamesome stuff about  spouters  
and c blubber-boilers   and such like pretty exclamations  



304 moby-dick 

why it is that all merchant seamen  and also all pirates 
and man-of-war s men  and slave-ship sailors  cherish 
such a scornful feeling toward whale-ships   this is a 
question it would be hard to answer  because  in the 
case of pirates  say  i should like to know whether that 
profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it  it 
sometimes ends in uncommon elevation  indeed   but only 
at the gallows  and besides  when a man is elevated in 
that odd fashion  he has no proper foundation for his 
superior altitude  hence  i conclude  that in boasting 
himself to be high lifted above a whaleman  in that 
assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on  

but what is a gam   you might wear out your index 
finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries  
and never find the word  dr  johnson never attained 
to that erudition   noah webster s ark does not hold it  
nevertheless  this same expressive word has now for 
many years been in constant use among some fifteen 
thousand true-born yankees  certainly  it needs a 
definition  and should be incorporated into the lexicon  
with that view  let me learnedly define it  

gam  noun a social meeting of two  or more  
whale-ships  generally on a cruising-ground   when  after 
exchanging hails  they exchange visits by boats  crews   the 
two captains remaining  for the time  on board of one ship t 
and the two chief mates on the other  

there is another little item about gamming which must 
not be forgotten here  all professions have their own 
little peculiarities of detail   so has the whale-fishery  in 
a pirate  man-of-war  or slave-ship  when the captain 
is rowed anywhere hi his boat  he always sits in the stern- 
sheets on a comfortable  sometimes cushioned seat there  
and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner s 
tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons  but the 
whale-boat has no seat astern  no sofa of that sort what- 



the gam 305 

ever  and no tiller at all  high times indeed  if whaling- 
captains were wheeled about the water on castors like 
gouty old aldermen in patent chairs  and as for a tiller  
the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy   and 
therefore as in gamming a complete boat s crew must 
leave the ship  and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer 
is of the number  that subordinate is the steersman upon 
the occasion  and the captain  having no place to sit in  
is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine-tree  and 
often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of 
the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of 
the two ships  this standing captain is all alive to the 
importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his 
legs  nor is this any very easy matter   for in his rear 
is the immense projecting steering-oar hitting him now 
and then in the small of his back  the after-oar reciprocat- 
ing by rapping his knees in front  he is thus completely 
wedged before and behind  and can only expand himself 
sideways by settling down on his stretched legs   but a 
sudden  violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple 
him  because length of foundation is nothing without 
corresponding breadth  merely make a spread angle of 
two poles  and you cannot stand them up  then  again  
it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted 
eyes  it would never do  i say  for this straddling captain 
to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by 
catching hold of anything with his hands   indeed  as 
token of his entire  buoyant self-command  he generally 
carries his hands in his trowsers  pockets   but perhaps 
being generally very large  heavy hands  he carries them 
there for ballast  nevertheless there have occurred 
instances  well authenticated ones too  where the captain 
has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or 
two  in a sudden squall  say to seize hold of the nearest 
oarsman s hair  and hold on there like grim death

the town-ho s story 

 as told at the golden inn   

the cape of good hope  and all the watery region round 
about there  is much like some noted four corners of a 
great highway  where you meet more travellers than in 
any other part  

it was not very long after speaking the goney that 
another homeward-bound whaleman  the town-ho  was 
encountered  she was manned almost wholly by poly- 
nesians  in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong 
news of moby-dick  to some the general interest in the 
white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance 
of the town-ho  s story  which seemed obscurely to in- 
volve with the whale a certain wondrous  inverted visi- 
tation of one of those so-called judgments of god which 
at times are said to overtake some men  this latter 
circumstance  with its own particular accompaniments  
forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy 
about to be narrated  never reached the ears of captain 
ahab or his mates  for that secret part of the story was 
unknown to the captain of the town-ho himself  it was 
the private property of three confederate white seamen 
of that ship  one of whom  it seems  communicated it to 
tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy  but the 
following night tashtego rambled in his sleep

revealed so much of it in that way  that when he was 
wakened he could not well withhold the rest  neverthe- 
less  so potent an influence did this thing have on those 
seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of 
it  and by such a strange delicacy  to call it so  were they 
governed in this matter  that they kept the secret among 
themselves so that it never transpired abaft the peqiwd s 
mainmast  interweaving in its proper place this darker 
thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship  
the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on 
lasting record  

for my humour s sake  i shall preserve the style in 
which i once narrated it at lima  to a lounging circle of 
my spanish friends  one saint s eve  smoking upon the 
thick-gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn  of those fine 
cavaliers  the young dons  pedro and sebastian  were on 
the closer terms with me   and hence the interluding 
questions they occasionally put  and which are duly 
answered at the time  

4 some two years prior to my first learning the events 
which i am about rehearsing to you  gentlemen  the town- 
ho  sperm whaler of nantucket  was cruising in your 
pacific here  not very many days  sail westward from the 
eaves of this good golden inn  she was somewhere 
to the northward of the line  one morning upon hand- 
ling the pumps  according to daily usage  it was observed 
that she made more water in her hold than common  
they supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her  gentlemen  
but the captain  having some unusual reason for believing 
that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes  and 
therefore being very averse to quit them   and the leak 
not being then considered at all dangerous  though  
indeed  they could not find it after searching the hold as 
low down as was possible in rather heavy weather   the 
ship still continued her cruisings  the mariners working 



308 moby-dick 

at the pumps at wide and easy intervals   but no good luck 
came   more days went by  and not only was the leak yet 
undiscovered  but it sensibly increased  so much so  
that now taking some alarm  the captain  making all sail  
stood away for the nearest harbour among the islands  
there to have his hull hove out and repaired  

4 though no small passage was before her  yet  if the 
commonest chance favoured  he did not at all fear that 
his ship would founder by the way  because his pumps 
were of the best  and being periodically relieved at them  
those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship 
free   never mind if the leak should double on her  in 
truth  well-nigh the whole of this passage being attended 
by very prosperous breezes  the town-ho had all but 
certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without 
the occurrence of the least fatality  had it not been for the 
brutal overbearing of radney  the mate  a vineyarder  and 
the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt  a lakeman 
and desperado from buffalo  

    lakeman   buffalo   pray  what is a lakeman  
and where is buffalo     said don sebastian  rising in his 
swinging mat of grass  

  on the eastern shore of our lake erie  don   but 
i crave your courtesy maybe  you shall soon hear 
further of all that  now  gentlemen  in square-sail brigs 
and three-masted ships  well-nigh as large and stout as 
any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla   
this lakeman  in the land-locked heart of our america  
had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting 
impressions popularly connected with the open ocean  
for in their interflowing aggregate  those grand fresh- 
water seas of ours  erie  and ontario  and huron  and 
superior  and michigan  possess an ocean -like expansive- 
ness  with many of the ocean s noblest traits   with many 
of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes  they

contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles  even as the 
polynesian waters do   in large part  are shored by two 
great contrasting nations  as the atlantic is   they furnish 
long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial 
colonies from the east  dotted all round their banks     
here and there are frowned upon by batteries  and by 
the goat-like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw   they have 
heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories   at intervals 
they yield their beaches to wild barbarians  whose red- 
painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams   for 
leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered 
forests  where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of 
kings in gothic genealogies   those same woods harbour- 
ing wild afric beasts of prey  and silken creatures whose 
exported furs give robes to tartar emperors   they mirror 
the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland  as well as 
winnebago villages   they float alike the full-rigged 
merchant ship  the armed cruiser of the state  the steamer  
and the beech canoe   they are swept by borean and dis- 
masting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave   
they know what shipwrecks are  for out of sight of land  
however inland  they have drowned full many a midnight 
ship with all its shrieking crew  thus  gentlemen  though 
an inlander  steelkilt was wild-ocean born  and wild- 
ocean nurtured   as much of an audacious mariner as 
any  and for radney  though in his infancy he may have 
laid him down on the lone nantucket beach  to nurse at 
his maternal sea   though in after life he had long followed 
our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific   yet 
was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the 
backwoods seaman  fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn 
handled bowie-knives  yet was this nantucketer a man 
with some good-hearted traits   and this lakeman  a 
mariner  who though a sort of devil indeed  might yet by 
inflexible firmness  only tempered by that common 



310 moby-dick 

decency of human recognition which is the meanest 
slave s right   thus treated  this steelkilt had long been 
retained harmless and docile  at all events  he had 
proved so thus far   but radney was doomed and made 
mad  and steelkilt but  gentlemen  you shall hear  

  it was not more than a day or two at the furthest 
after pointing her prow for her island haven  that the 
town-ho s leak seemed again increasing  but only so as 
to require an hour or more at the pumps every day  you 
must know that in a settled and civilised ocean like our 
atlantic  for example  some skippers think little of pump- 
ing their whole way across it   though of a still  sleepy 
night  should the officer of the deck happen to forget his 
duty in that respect  the probability would be that he 
and his shipmates would never again remember it  on 
account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom  nor 
in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the west- 
ward  gentlemen  is it altogether unusual for ships to 
keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even 
for a voyage of considerable length   that is  if it lie along 
a tolerably accessible coast  or if any other reasonable 
retreat is afforded them  it is only when a leaky vessel 
is in some very out-of-the-way part of those waters  some 
really landless latitude  that her captain begins to feel 
a little anxious  

  much this way had it been with the town-ho   so 
when her leak was found gaining once more  there was 
in truth some small concern manifested by several of her 
company   especially by radney the mate  he com- 
manded the upper sails to be well hoisted  sheeted home 
anew  and every way expanded to the breeze  now this 
radney  i suppose  was as little of a coward  and as little 
inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching 
his own person  as any fearless  unthinking creature on 
land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine  gentle- 



the town-ho s story 311 

men  therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about 
the safety of the ship  some of the seamen declared that 
it was only on account of his being a part owner in her  
so when they were working that evening at the pumps  
there was on this head no small gamesomeness slyly going 
on among them  as they stood with their feet continually 
overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any 
mountain spring  gentlemen that bubbling from the 
pumps ran across the deck  and poured itself out in steady 
spouts at the lee scupper-holes  

4 now  as you well know  it is not seldom the case hi 
this conventional world of ours watery or otherwise   
that when a person placed in command over his fellow- 
men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior 
in general pride of manhood  straightway against that 
man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness   
and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverise that 
subaltern s tower  and make a little heap of dust of it  
be this conceit of mine as it may  gentlemen  at all events 
steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a 
roman  and a flowing golden beard like the tasselled 
housings of your last viceroy s snorting charger   and a 
brain  and a heart  and a soul in him  gentlemen  which 
had made steelkilt charlemagne  had he been born son 
to charlemagne s father  but radney  the mate  was 
ugly as a mule   yet as hardy  as stubborn  as malicious  
he did not love steelkilt  and steelkilt knew it  

  espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at 
the pump with the rest  the lakeman affected not to 
notice him  but unawed  went on with his gay banterings  

    ay  ay  my merry lads  it  s a lively leak this   
hold a cannikin  one of ye  and let  s have a taste  by the 
lord  it  s worth bottling   i tell ye what  men  old rad s 
investment must go for it   he had best cut away his part 
of the hull and tow it home  the fact is  boys  that sword-

fish only began the job   he  s come back again with a 
gang of ship-carpenters  saw-fish  and file-fish  and what 
not   and the whole posse of  em are now hard at work 
cutting and slashing at the bottom   making improve- 
ments  i suppose  if old rad were here now  i  d tell 
him to jump overboard and scatter  em  they  re play- 
ing the devil with his estate  i can tell him  but he  s a 
simple old soul  rad  and a beauty too  boys  they say 
the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses  i 
wonder if he  d give a poor devil like me the model of his 
nose   

    damn your eyes   what  s that pump stopping f or     
roared radney  pretending not to have heard the sailors  
talk    thunder away at it     

  ay  ay  sir   said steelkilt  merry as a cricket  
  lively  boys  lively  now     and with that the pump 
clanged like fifty fire-engines   the men tossed their hats 
off to it  and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs 
was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life s 
utmost energies  

  quitting the pump at last  with the rest of his band  
the lakeman went forward all panting  and sat himself 
down on the windlass   his face fiery red  his eyes blood- 
shot  and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow  now 
what cozening fiend it was  gentlemen  that possessed 
radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally 
exasperated state  i know not   but so it happened  in- 
tolerably striding along the deck  the mate commanded 
him to get a broom and sweep down the planks  and also 
a shovel  and remove some offensive matters consequent 
upon allowing a pig to run at large  

  now  gentlemen  sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a 
piece of household work which in all times but raging 
gales is regularly attended to every evening   it has been 
known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering 



the town-ho s story 313 

at the time  such  gentlemen  is the inflexibility of sea- 
usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen   
some of whom would not willingly drown without first 
washing their faces  but in all vessels this broom business 
is the prescriptive province of the boys  if boys there be 
aboard  besides  it was the stronger men in the town-ho 
that had been divided into gangs  taking turns at the 
pumps   and being the most athletic seaman of them all  
steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of 
the gangs   consequently he should have been freed from 
any trivial business not connected with truly nautical 
duties  such being the case with his comrades  i mention 
all these particulars so that you may understand exactly 
how this affair stood between the two men  

  but there was more than this   the order about the 
shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult 
steelkilt  as though radney had spat in his face  any 
man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand 
this   and all this and doubtless much more  the lakeman 
fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command  
but as he sat still for a moment  and as he steadfastly 
looked into the mate s malignant eye and perceived the 
stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow- 
match silently burning along toward them   as he in- 
stinctively saw all this  that strange forbearance and un- 
willingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any 
already ireful being a repugnance most felt  when felt 
at all  by really valiant men even when aggrieved this 
nameless phantom feeling  gentlemen  stole over steelkilt  

  therefore  in his ordinary tone  only a little broken 
by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in  he an- 
swered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his 
business  and he would not do it  and then  without at 
all alluding to the shovel  he pointed to three lads as the 
customary sweepers   who  not being billeted at the 



314 moby-dick 

pumps  had done little or nothing all day  to this  
radney replied with an oath  in a most domineering and 
outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his com- 
mand   meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lake- 
man  with an uplifted cooper s club hammer which he had 
snatched from a cask near by  

  heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil 
at the pumps  for all his first nameless feeling of forbear- 
ance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing 
in the mate   but somehow still smothering the conflagra- 
tion within him  without speaking he remained doggedly 
rooted to his seat  till at last the incensed radney shook 
the hammer within a few inches of his face  furiously 
commanding him to do his bidding  

4 steelkilt rose  and slowly retreating round the wind- 
lass  steadily followed by the mate with his menacing 
hammer  deliberately repeated his intention not to obey  
seeing  however  that his forbearance had not the slightest 
effect  by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his 
twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated 
man   but it was to no purpose  and in this way the 
two went once slowly round the windlass   when  resolved 
at last no longer to retreat  bethinking him that he had 
now forborne as much as comported with his humour  
the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to 
the officer   

1   mr  radney  i will not obey you  take that 
hammer away  or look to yourself   but the predestin- 
ated mate coming still closer to him  where the lakeman 
stood fixed  now shook the heavy hammer within an inch 
of his teeth   meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable 
maledictions  retreating not the thousandth part of an 
inch   stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching 
poniard of his glance  steelkilt  clenching his right hand 
behind him and creepingly drawing it back  told his perse- 



the town-ho s story 315 

cutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he  steel- 
kilt  would murder him  but  gentlemen  the fool had 
been branded for the slaughter by the gods  immediately 
the hammer touched the cheek   the next instant the 
lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head   he fell on 
the hatch spouting blood like a whale  

  ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of 
the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his com- 
rades were standing their mast-heads  they were both 
canallers  

    canallers     cried don pedro    we have seen 
many whale -ships in our harbours  but never heard of 
your canallers  pardon   who and what are they     

    canallers  don  are the boatmen belonging to our 
grand erie canal  you must have heard of it   

    nay  senor   hereabouts in this dull  warm  most 
lazy  and hereditary land  we know but little of your 
vigorous north   

    ay   well then  don  refill my cup  your 
chicha  s very fine   and ere proceeding further i will tell 
ye what our canallers are   for such information may 
throw side-light upon my story   

4 for three hundred and sixty miles  gentlemen  through 
the entire breadth of the state of new york   through 
numerous populous cities and most thriving villages   
through long  dismal  uninhabited swamps  and affluent  
cultivated fields  unrivalled for fertility   by billiard- 
room and bar-room   through the holy-of-holies of great 
forests   on roman arches over indian rivers   through

pagans   where you ever find them  next door to you   
under the long-flung shadow  and the snug patronising 
lee of churches  for by some curious fatality  as it is 
often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they 
ever encamp around the halls of justice  so sinners  gentle- 
men  most abound in holiest vicinities

downward into the crowded plaza  with humorous 
concern  

    well for our northern friend  dame isabella s in- 
quisition wanes in lima   laughed don sebastian    pro- 
ceed  senor   

    a moment   pardon     cried another of the com- 
pany    in the name of all us limeese  i but desire to 
express to you  sir sailor  that we have by no means over- 
looked your delicacy in not substituting present lima 
for distant venice in your corrupt comparison  oh   do 
not bow and look surprised   you know the proverb all 
along this coast  corrupt as lima   it but bears out 
your saying  too   churches more plentiful than billiard- 
tables  and forever open and   corrupt as lima   so  
too  venice   i have been there   the holy city of the 
blessed evangelist  st  mark   st  dominic  purge it

1 freely depicted in his own vocation  gentlemen  the 
canaller would make a fine dramatic hero  so abundantly 
and picturesquely wicked is he  like mark antony  for 
days and days along his green-turfed  flowery nile  he 
indolently floats  openly toying with his red-cheeked 
cleopatra  ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck  
but ashore  all this effeminacy is dashed  the brigandish 
guise which the canaller so proudly sports  his slouched 
and gaily -ribboned hat  betoken his grand features  a 
terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through

which he floats   his swart visage and bold swagger are 
not unshunned in cities  once a vagabond on his own 
canal  i have received good turns from one of these 
canallers   i thank him heartily   would fain be not 
ungrateful   but it is often one of the prime redeeming 
qualities of your man of violence  that at times he has 
as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait  as to 
plunder a wealthy one  in sum  gentlemen  what the 
wildness of this canal life is  is emphatically evinced by 
this   that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of 
its most finished graduates  and that scarce any race of 
mankind  except sydney men  are so much distrusted by 
our whaling-captains  nor does it at all diminish the 
curiousness of this matter  that to many thousands of our 
rural boys and young men born along its line  the pro- 
bationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole tran- 
sition between quietly reaping in a christian corn-field  
and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric 
seas  

    i see   i see     impetuously exclaimed don pedro  
spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles    no need to 
travel   the world 5 s one lima  i had thought  now  
that at your temperate north the generations were cold 
and holy as the hills  but the story   

  i left off  gentlemen  where the lakeman shook the 
backstay  hardly had he done so  when he was sur- 
rounded by the three junior mates and the four har- 
pooneers  who all crowded him to the deck  but sliding 
down the ropes like baleful comets  the two canallers 
rushed into the uproar  and sought to drag their man out 
of it toward the forecastle  others of the sailors joined 
with them in this attempt  and a twisted turmoil ensued   
while standing out of harm s way  the valiant captain 
danced up and down with a whale-pike  calling upon his 
officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel  and smoke

him along to the quarter-deck  at intervals  he ran close 
up to the revolving border of the confusion  and prying 
into the heart of it with his pike  sought to prick out the 
object of his resentment  but steelkilt and his desper- 
adoes were too much for them all   they succeeded in 
gaining the forecastle deck  where  hastily slewing about 
three or four large casks in a line with the windlass  these 
sea-parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade  

    come out of that  ye pirates     roared the captain  
now menacing them with a pistol in each hand  just 
brought to him by the steward    come out of that  ye 
cut -throats     

  steelkilt leaped on the barricade  and striding up and 
down there  defied the worst the pistols could do   but 
gave the captain to understand distinctly  that his  steel- 
kilt s  death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny 
on the part of all hands  fearing in his heart lest this 
might prove but too true  the captain a little desisted  but 
still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to 
their duty  

    will you promise not to touch us  if we do     
demanded their ringleader  

    turn to   turn to   i make no promise   to your 
duty   do you want to sink the ship  by knocking off 
at a time like this   turn to     and he once more raised 
a pistol  

    sink the ship     cried steelkilt    ay  let her 
sink  not a man of us turns to  unless you swear not to 
raise a rope-yarn against us  what say ye  men 1   
turning to his comrades  a fierce cheer was their response  

  the lakeman now patrolled the barricade  all the 
while keeping his eye on the captain  and jerking out such 
sentences as these    it  s not our fault   we didn t 
want it   i told him to take his hammer away   it was 
boy 3 s business   he might have known me before this   



the town-ho s story 319 

i told him not to prick the buffalo   i believe i have broken 
a finger here against his cursed jaw   ain t those mincing- 
knives down in the forecastle there  men   look to those 
handspikes  my hearties  captain  by god  look to 
yourself   say the word   don t be a fool   forget it all   
we are ready to turn to   treat us decently  and we  re 
your men   but we won t be flogged   

    turn to   i make no promises  turn to  i say     

    look ye  now   cried the lake man  flinging out his 
arm toward him    there are a few of us here  and i am 
one of them  who have shipped for the cruise  d  ye see   
now as you well know  sir  we can claim our discharge as 
soon as the anchor is down   so we don t want a row   it  s 
not our interest   we want to be peaceable   we are ready 
to work  but we won t be flogged   

    turn to     roared the captain  

  steelkilt glanced round him a moment  and then 
said     i tell you what it is now  captain  rather than 
kill ye  and be hung for such a shabby rascal  we won t 
lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us   but till you 
say the word about not flogging us  we don t do a hand s 
turn   

6   down into the forecastle then  down with ye  i  11 
keep ye there till ye  re sick of it  down ye go   

    shall we     cried the ringleader to his men  most 
of them were against it   but at length  in obedience to 
steelkilt  they preceded him down into their dark den  
growlingly disappearing  like bears into a cave  

  as the lakeman s bare head was just level with the 
planks  the captain and his posse leaped the barricade  
and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle  planted 
their group of hands upon it  and loudly called for the 
steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the 
companion-way  then opening the slide a little  the 
captain whispered something down the crack  closed it  



320 moby-dick 

and turned the key upon them ten in number leaving 
on deck some twenty or more  who thus far had remained 
neutral  

  all night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the 
officers  forward and aft  especially about the forecastle 
scuttle and fore-hatchway   at which last place it was 
feared the insurgents might emerge  after breaking through 
the bulkhead below  but the hours of darkness passed 
in peace   the men who still remained at their duty toiling 
hard at the pumps  whose clinking and clanking at inter- 
vals through the dreary night dismally resounded through 
the ship  

  at sunrise the captain went forward  and knocking 
on the deck  summoned the prisoners to work   but with 
a yell they refused  water was then lowered down to 
them  and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after 
it   when again turning the key upon them and pocketing 
it  the captain returned to the quarter-deck  twice 
every day for three days this was repeated   but on the 
fourth morning a confused wrangling  and then a scuffling 
was heard  as the customary summons was delivered   
and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle  
saying they were ready to turn to  the fetid closeness 
of the ah   and a famishing diet  united perhaps to some 
fears of ultimate retribution  had constrained them to 
surrender at discretion  emboldened by this  the captain 
reiterated his demand to the rest  but steelkilt shouted 
up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake 
himself where he belonged  on the fifth morning three 
others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the 
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them  
only three were left  

    better turn to  now     said the captain  with a 
heartless jeer  

    shut us up again  will ye     cried steelkilt  



the town-ho s story 321 

4   oh   certainly   said the captain  and the key clicked  

  it was at this point  gentlemen  that enraged by the 
defection of seven of his former associates  and stung by the 
mocking voice that had last hailed him  and maddened 
by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels 
of despair   it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two 
canallers  thus far apparently of one mind with him  to 
burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the 
garrison   and armed with their keen mincing-knives 
 long  crescentic  heavy implements with a handle at each 
end  run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail   and if 
by any devilishness of desperation possible  seize the ship  
for himself  he would do this  he said  whether they joined 
him or not  that was the last night he should spend in 
that den  but the scheme met with no opposition on 
the part of the other two   they swore they were ready for 
that  or for any other mad thing  for anything in short 
but a surrender  and what was more  they each insisted 
upon being the first man on deck  when the time to make 
the rush should come  but to this their leader as fiercely 
objected  reserving that priority for himself   particularly 
as his two comrades would not yield  the one to the other  
in the matter   and both of them could not be first  for 
the ladder would but admit one man at a time  and 
here  gentlemen  the foul play of these miscreants must 
come out  

  upon hearing the frantic project of their leader  each 
in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted  it would 
seem  upon the same piece of treachery  namely   to be 
foremost in breaking out  in order to be the first of the 
three  though the last of the ten  to surrender   and there- 
by secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct 
might merit  but when steelkilt made known his deter- 
mination still to lead them to the last  they in some way  by 
some subtle chemistry of villainy  mixed their before secret

treacheries together   and when their leader fell into a 
doze  verbally opened their souls to each other in three 
sentences   and bound the sleeper with cords  and gagged 
him with cords   and shrieked out for the captain at 
midnight  

  thinking murder at hand  and smelling in the dark 
for the blood  he and all his armed mates and harpooneers 
rushed for the forecastle  in a few minutes the scuttle 
was opened  and  bound hand and foot  the still struggling 
ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious 
allies  who at once claimed the honour of securing a man 
who had been fully ripe for murder  but all these were 
collared  and dragged along the deck like dead cattle   and  
side by side  were seized up into the mizen rigging  like 
three quarters of meat  and there they hung till morning  
  damn ye   cried the captain  pacing to and fro before 
them    the vultures would not touch ye  ye villains     

  at sunrise he summoned all hands   and separating 
those who had rebelled from those who had taken no 
part in the mutiny  he told the former that he had a good 
mind to flog them all round thought  upon the whole  
he would do so he ought to justice demanded it   but 
for the present  considering their timely surrender  he 
would let them go with a reprimand  which he accordingly 
administered in the vernacular  

    but as for you  ye carrion rogues   turning to the 
three men in the rigging   for you  i mean to mince ye 
up for the try -pots     and  seizing a rope  he applied it 
with all his might to the backs of the two traitors  till 
they yelled no more  but lifelessly hung their heads side- 
ways  as the two crucified thieves are drawn  

4   my wrist is sprained with ye     he cried  at last   
  but there is still rope enough left for you  my fine 
bantam  that wouldn t give up  take that gag from his 
mouth  and let us hear what he can say for himself   



the town-ho s story 323 

  for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremu- 
lous motion of his cramped jaws  and then painfully 
twisting round his head  said in a sort of hiss    what i 
say is this and mind it well if you flog me  i murder 
you     

    say ye so   then see how ye frighten me   and 
the captain drew off with the rope to strike  

    best not   hissed the lakeman  

    but i must   and the rope was once more drawn 
back for the stroke  

  steelkilt here hissed out something  inaudible to all 
but the captain   who  to the amazement of all hands  
started back  paced the deck rapidly two or three times  
and then suddenly throwing down his rope  said    i won t 
do it let him go cut him down   d  ye hear     

  but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the 
order  a pale man  with a bandaged head  arrested them 
radney the chief mate  ever since the blow  he had 
lain in his berth   but that morning  hearing the tumult 
on the deck  he had crept out  and thus far had watched 
the whole scene  such was the state of his mouth  that 
he could hardly speak   but mumbling something about 
his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not 
attempt  he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned 
foe  

    you are a coward     hissed the lakeman  

    so i am  but take that   the mate was in the very 
act of striking  when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm  
he paused   and then pausing no more  made good his 
word  spite of steelkilt  s threat  whatever that might have 
been  the three men were then cut down  all hands were 
turned to  and  sullenly worked by the moody seamen  the 
iron pumps clanged as before  

  just after dark that day  when one watch had retired 
below  a clamour was heard in the forecastle   and the 



324 moby-dick 

two trembling traitors running up  besieged the cabin 
door  saying they durst not consort with the crew  en- 
treaties  cuffs  and kicks could not drive them back  so 
at their own instance they were put down in the ship s run 
for salvation  still  no sign of mutiny reappeared among 
the rest  on the contrary  it seemed  that mainly at 
steelkilt s instigation  they had resolved to maintain 
the strictest peacefulness  obey all orders to the last  and  
when the ship reached port  desert her in a body  but in 
order to ensure the speediest end to the voyage  they all 
agreed to another thing namely  not to sing out for 
whales  in case any should be discovered  for  spite of 
her leak  and spite of all her other perils  the town-ho 
still maintained her mast-heads  and her captain was just 
as willing to lower for a fish that moment  as on the day 
his craft first struck the cruising -ground   and radney 
the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat  
and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the 
vital jaw of the whale  

  but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to 
adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct  he kept 
his own counsel  at least till all was over  concerning his 
own proper and private revenge upon the man who had 
stung him in the ventricles of his heart  he was in 
radney the chief mate s watch   and as if the infatuated 
man sought to run more than half-way to meet his doom  
after the scene at the rigging  he insisted  against the 
express counsel of the captain  upon resuming the head 
of his watch at night  upon this  and one or two other 
circumstances  steelkilt systematically built the plan of his 
revenge  

  during the night  radney had an unseamanlike way 
of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck  and leaning 
his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted 
up there  a little above the ship s side  in this attitude  



the town-ho s story 325 

it was well known  he sometimes dozed  there was a 
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship  and 
down between this was the sea  steelkilt calculated his 
time  and found that his next trick at the helm would 
come round at two o clock  in the morning of the third 
day from that in which he had been betrayed  at his 
leisure  he employed the interval in braiding something 
very carefully in his watches below  

    what are you making there     said a shipmate  

c   what do you think   what does it look like     

    like a lanyard for your bag   but it  s an odd one  
seems to me   

    yes  rather oddish   said the lakeman  holding it 
at arm s length before him     but i think it will answer  
shipmate  i haven t enough twine  have you any     

  but there was none in the forecastle  

    then i must get some from old had     and he rose 
to go aft  

    you don t mean to go a-begging to him i   said a 
sailor  

    why not   do you think he won t do me a turn  
when it  s to help himself in the end  shipmate     and 
going to the mate  he looked at him quietly  and asked 
him for some twine to mend his hammock  it was given 
him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again   but 
the next night an iron ball  closely netted  partly rolled 
from the pocket of the lakeman s monkey-jacket  as he 
was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow  
twenty-four hours after  his trick at the silent helm 
nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always 
ready dug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour was then 
to come   and in the fore -ordaining soul of steelkilt  the 
mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse  with his 
forehead crushed in

326 moby-dick 

from the bloody deed he had planned  yet complete 
revenge he had  and without being the avenger  for by 
a mysterious fatality  heaven itself seemed to step in to 
take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he 
would have done  

1 it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the 
morning of the second day  when they were washing down 
the decks  that a stupid teneriffe man  drawing water in 
the main-chains  all at once shouted out    there she rolls   
there she rolls     jesu  what a whale   it was mahv jqick  

4   moby-dick     cried don sebastian     st  dominic   
sir sailor  but do whales have christenings   whom call 
you moby-dick     

4   a very white  and famous  and most deadly immortal 
monster  don   but that would be too long a story   

4   how   how     cried all the young spaniards  
crowding  

    nay  dons  dons nay  nay   i cannot rehearse 
that now  let me get more into the air  sirs   

4   chicha   the chicha     cried don pedro     our 
vigorous friend looks faint   fill up his empty glass     

4 no need  gentlemen   one moment  and i proceed  
now  gentlemen  so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale 
within fifty yards of the ship forgetful of the compact 
among the crew in the excitement of the moment  the 
teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted 
his voice for the monster  though for some little time past 
it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads  
all was now a frenzy    the white whale the white 
whale     was the cry from captain  mates  and har- 
pooneers  who  undeterred by fearful rumours  were all 
anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish   while 
the dogged crew eyed askance  and with curses  the appal- 
ling beauty of the vast milky mass  that lit up by a hori- 
zontal spangling sun  shifted and glistened like a living 



the town-ho s story 327 

opal in the blue morning sea  gentlemen  a strange 
fatality pervades the whole career of these events  as if 
verily mapped out before the world itself was charted  
the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate  and when 
fast to a fish  it was his duty to sit next him  while radney 
stood up with his lance in the prow  and haul in or slacken 
the line  at the word of command  moreover  when the 
four boats were lowered  the mate s got the start   and 
none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt  
as he strained at his oar  after a stiff pull  their har- 
pooneer got fast  and  spear in hand  radney sprang to 
the bow  he was always a furious man  it seems  in a 
boat  and now his bandaged cry was  to beach him 
on the whale s topmost back  nothing loath  his bows- 
man hauled him up and up  through a blinding foam that 
blent two whitenesses together   till of a sudden the boat 
struck as against a sunken ledge  and keeling over  spilled 
out the standing mate  that instant  as he fell on the 
whale s slippery back  the boat righted  and was dashed 
aside by the swell  while radney was tossed over into the 
sea  on the other flank of the whale   he struck out through 
the spray  and  for an instant  was dimly seen through 
that veil  wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye 
of moby-dick  but the whale rushed round in a sudden 
maelstrom   seized the swimmer between his jaws   and 
rearing high up with him  plunged headlong again  and 
went down  

  meantime  at the first tap of the boat s bottom  the 
lakeman had slackened the line  so as to drop astern from 
the whirlpool   calmly looking on  he thought his own 
thoughts  but a sudden  terrific  downward jerking 
of the boat  quickly brought his knife to the line  he 
cut it   and the whale was free  but  at some distance  
moby-dick rose again  with some tatters of radney  s 
red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed 



328 moby-dick 

him  all four boats gave chase again   but the whale 
eluded them  and finally wholly disappeared  

  in good time  the town-ho reached her port a savage  
solitary place where no civilised creature resided  
there  headed by the lake man  all but five or six of the 
foremast-men deliberately deserted among the palms   
eventually  as it turned out  seizing a large double war- 
canoe of the savages  and setting sail for some other 
harbour  

4 the ship s company being reduced to but a handful  
the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the 
laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the 
leak  but to such unresting vigilance over their danger- 
ous allies was this small band of whites necessitated  both 
by night and by day  and so extreme was the hard work 
they underwent  that upon the vessel being ready again 
for sea  they were in such a weakened condition that the 
captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel  
after taking counsel with his officers  he anchored the 
ship as far off shore as possible   loaded and ran out his 
two cannon from the bows   stacked his muskets on the 
poop   and warning the islanders not to approach the 
ship at their peril  took one man with him  and setting 
the sail of his best whale-boat  steered straight before the 
wind for tahiti  five hundred miles distant  to procure 
a reinforcement to his crew  

  on the fourth day of the sail  a large canoe was 
descried  which seemed to have touched at a low isle of 
corals  he steered away from it   but the savage craft 
bore down on him   and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed 
him to heave to  or he would run him under water  the 
captain presented a pistol  with one foot on each prow 
of the yoked war-canoes  the lakeman laughed him to 
scorn   assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked 
in the lock  he would bury him in bubbles and foam  



the town-ho s story 329 

    what do you want of me     cried the captain  

    where are you bound   and for what are you 
bound     demanded steelkilt    no lies   

    i am bound to tahiti for more men   

    very good  let me board you a moment i come 
in peace   with that he leaped from the canoe  swam to 
the boat   and climbing the gunwale  stood face to face 
with the captain  

  cross your arms  sir   throw back your head  now  
repeat after me  as soon as steelkilt leaves me  i swear 
to beach this boat on yonder island  and remain there six 
days  if i do not  may lightnings strike me     

    a pretty scholar   laughed the lakeman    adios  
senor     and leaping into the sea  he swam back to his 
comrades  

  watching the boat till it was fairly beached  and 
drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees  steelkilt 
made sail again  and in due time arrived at tahiti  his 
own place of destination  there  luck befriended him   
two ships were about to sail for france  and were provi- 
dentially in want of precisely that number of men which 
the sailor headed  they embarked   and so forever got 
the start of their former captain  had he been at all minded 
to work them legal retribution  

  some ten days after the french ships sailed  the whale- 
boat arrived  and the captain was forced to enlist some of 
the more civilised tahitians  who had been somewhat 
used to the sea  chartering a small native schooner  he 
returned with them to his vessel   and finding all right 
there  again resumed his cruisings  

  where steelkilt now is  gentlemen  none know   but 
upon the island of nantucket  the widow of radney still 
turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead   still 
in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed 
him

    are you through     said don sebastian quietly  

1   i am  don   

6   then i entreat you  tell me if to the best of your 
own convictions  this your story is in substance really 
true   it is so passing wonderful   did you get it from an 
unquestionable source   bear with me if i seem to press   

    also bear with all of us  sir sailor   for we all join 
in don sebastian s suit   cried the company  with exceed- 
ing interest  

    is there a copy of the holy evangelists hi the golden 
inn  gentlemen     

    nay   said don sebastian     but i know a worthy 
priest near by  who will quickly procure one for me  i 
go for it   but are you well advised   this may grow too 
serious   

    will you be so good as to bring the priest also  don     

    though there are no auto-da-fes in lima now   
said one of the company to another    i fear our sailor 
friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy  let us withdraw 
more out of the moonlight  i see no need of this   

    excuse me for running after you  don sebastian   
but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring 

the largest -sized evangelists you can   

        

    this is the priest  he brings you the evangelists   
said don sebastian gravely  returning with a tall and 
solemn figure  

    let me remove my hat  now  venerable priest  
further into the light  and hold the holy book before me 
that i may touch it  

    so help me heaven  and on my honour the story i 
have told ye  gentlemen  is in substance and its great 
items  true  i know it to be true   it happened on this 
ball   i trod the ship   i knew the crew   i have seen and 
talked with steelkilt since the death of radney   



chapter lv 

of the monstrous pictures of whales 

i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without 
canvas  something like the true form of the whale as he 
actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his 
own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the 
whale -ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there  
it may be worth while  therefore  previously to advert 
to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even 
down to the present day confidently challenge the faith 
of the landsman  it is time to set the world right in 
this matter  by proving such pictures of the whale all 
wrong  

it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial 
delusions will be found among the oldest hindu  egyptian  
and grecian sculptures  for ever since those inventive 
but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings 
of temples  the pedestals of statues  and on shields  
medallions  cups  and coins  the dolphin was drawn in 
scales of chain-armour like saladin s  and a helmeted 
head like st  george s   ever since then has something 
of the same sort of licence prevailed  not only in most 
popular pictures of the whale  but in many scientific 
presentations of him  

now  by all odds  the most ancient extant portrait 
anyways purporting to be the whale s  is to be found in 
the famous cavern -pagoda of elephanta  in india  the 
brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures 
of that immemorial pagoda  all the trades and pursuits  

331 



332 moby-dick 

every conceivable avocation of man  were prefigured ages 
before any of them actually came into being  no wonder  
then  that in some sort our noble profession of whaling 
should have been there shadowed forth  the hindu 
whale referred to  occurs in a separate department of the 
wall  depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of 
leviathan  learnedly known as the matse avatar  but 
though this sculpture is half man and half whale  so as 
only to give the tail of the latter  yet that small section 
of him is all wrong  it looks more like the tapering tail 
of an anaconda a than the broad palms of the true whale s 
majestic flukes  

but go to the old galleries  and look now at a great 
christian painter s portrait of this fish   for he succeeds 
no better than the antediluvian hindu  it is guide s 
picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the sea- 
monster or whale  where did guido get the model of 
such a strange creature as that   nor does hogarth  in 
painting the same scene in his own   perseus descending   
make out one whit better  the huge corpulence of that 
hogarthian monster undulates on the surface  scarcely 
drawing one inch of water  it has a sort of howdah on its 
back  and its distended tusked mouth into which the 
billows are rolling  might be taken for the traitors  gate 
leading from the thames by water into the tower  then  
there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald  
and jonah s whale  as depicted in the prints of old bibles 
and the cuts of old primers  what shall be said of these   
as for the bookbinder s whale winding like a vine-stalk 
round the stock of a descending anchor as stamped and 
gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both 
old and new that is a very picturesque but purely 
fabulous creature  imitated  i take it  from the like figures 
on antique vases  though universally denominated a 
dolphin  i nevertheless call this bookbinder s fish an 



monstrous pictures of whales 333 

attempt at a whale   because it was so intended when the 
device was first introduced  it was introduced by an old 
italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century  
during the revival of learning   and in those days  and 
even down to a comparatively late period  dolphins were 
popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan  

in the vignettes and other embellishments of some 
ancient books you will at times meet with very curious 
touches at the whale  where all manner of spouts  jets 
d eau  hot springs and cold  saratoga and baden-baden  
come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain  in the 
title-page of the original edition of the advancement of 
learning you will find some curious whales  

but quitting all these unprofessional attempts  let us 
glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be 
sober  scientific delineations  by those who know  in 
old harris s collection of voyages there are some plates 
of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages  a d  
1671  entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship 
jonas in the whale  peter peterson of friesland  master  
in one of those plates the whales  like great rafts of 
logs  are represented lying among ice-isles  with white 
bears running over their living backs  in another 
plate  the prodigious blunder is made of representing 
the whale with perpendicular flukes  

then again  there is an imposing quarto  written by one 
captain colnett  a post-captain in the english navy  
entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south seas  
for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries  
in this book is an outline purporting to be a   picture of a 
physeter or spermaceti whale  drawn by scale from one 
killed on the coast of mexico  august 1793  and hoisted 
on deck   i doubt not the captain had this veracious 
picture taken for the benefit of his marines  to mention 
but one thing about it  let me say that it has an eye which 



334 moby-dick 

applied  according to the accompanying scale  to a full- 
grown sperm whale  would make the eye of that whale a 
bow- window some five feet long  ah  my gallant cap- 
tain  why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye   

nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural 
history for the benefit of the young and tender  free from 
the same heinousness of mistake  look at that popular 
work goldsmith s animated nature  in the abridged 
london edition of 1807  there are plates of an alleged 
 whale  and a  narwhale   i do not wish to seem 
inelegant  but this unsightly whale looks much like an 
amputated sow   and  as for the nar whale  one glimpse at 
it is enough to amaze one  that in this nineteenth century 
such a hippogrrff could be palmed for genuine upon any 
intelligent public of schoolboys  

then  again  in 1825  bernard germain  count de lace- 
pede  a great naturalist  published a scientific systematised 
whale book  wherein are several pictures of the different 
species of the leviathan  all these are not only incorrect  
but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale 
 that is to say  the right whale   even scoresby  a long- 
experienced man as touching that species  declares not 
to have its counterpart in nature  

but the placing of the cap -sheaf to all this blundering 
business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier  
brother to the famous baron  in 1836  he published a 
natural history of whales  in which he gives what he 
calls a picture of the sperm whale  before showing that 
picture to any nantucketer  you had best provide for 
your summary retreat from nantucket  in a word  
frederick cuvier s sperm whale is not a sperm whale  
but a squash  of course  he never had the benefit of a 
whaling voyage  such men seldom have   but whence he 
derived that picture  who can tell   perhaps he got it 
as his scientific predecessor in the same field  desmarest  



monstrous pictures of whales 335 

got one of his authentic abortions   that is  from a chinese 
drawing  and what sort of lively lads with the pencil 
those chinese are  many queer cups and saucers inform us  

as for the sign-painters  whales seen in the streets 
hanging over the shops of oil-dealers  what shall be said 
of them   they are generally richard in  whales  with 
dromedary humps  and very savage   breakfasting on 
three or four sailor tarts  that is whale-boats full of 
mariners   their deformities floundering in seas of blood 
and blue paint  

but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are 
not so very surprising after all  consider   most of the 
scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded 
fish   and these are about as correct as a drawing of a 
wrecked ship  with broken back  would correctly repre- 
sent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of 
hull and spars  though elephants have stood for their 
full-lengths  the living leviathan has never yet fairly 
floated himself for his portrait  the living whale  in his 
full majesty and significance  is only to be seen at sea in 
unfathomable waters   and afloat the vast bulk of him 
is out of sight  like a launched line-of-battle ship   and 
out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for 
mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air  so as to 
preserve all his mighty swells and undulations  and  
not to speak of the highly presumable difference of con- 
tour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown 
platonian leviathan   yet  even in the case of one of those 
young sucking whales hoisted to a ship s deck  such is 
then the outlandish  eel-like  limbered  varying shape of 
him  that his precise expression the devil himself could 
not catch  

but it may be fancied  that from the naked skeleton 
of the stranded whale  accurate hints may be derived 
touching his true form  not at all  for it is one of the 



336 moby-dick 

more curious things about this leviathan  that his skele- 
ton gives very little idea of his general shape  though 
jeremy bentham s skeleton  which hangs for candelabra 
in the library of one of his executors  correctly conveys 
the idea of a burly -browed utilitarian old gentleman  with 
all jeremy s other leading personal characteristics   yet 
nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan s 
articulated bones  in fact  as the great hunter says  the 
mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the 
fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to 
the chrysalis that so roundingly envelops it  this peculi- 
arity is strikingly evinced in the head  as in some part of 
this book will be incidentally shown  it is also very 
curiously displayed in the side fin  the bones of which 
almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand  
minus only the thumb  this fin has four regular bone- 
fingers  the index  middle  ring  and little finger  but all 
these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering  
as the human fingers in an artificial covering    however 
recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us  said 
humorous stubb one day    he can never be truly said to 
handle us without mittens   

for all these reasons  then  any way you may look at it  
you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that 
one creature in the world which must remain unpainted 
to the last  true  one portrait may hit the mark much 
nearer than another  but none can hit it with any very 
considerable degree of exactness  so there is no earthly 
way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks 
like  and the only mode in which you can derive even 
a tolerable idea of his living contour  is by going a-whaling 
yourself   but by so doing  you run no small risk of being 
eternally stove and sunk by him  wherefore  it seems to 
me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity 
touching this leviathan  



chapter lvi 

of the less erroneous pictures of whales  and the 
true pictures of whaling scenes 

in connection with the monstrous pictures of whales  i 
am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more 
monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain 
books  both ancient and modern  especially hi pliny  
purchas  hakluyt  harris  cuvier  etc  but i pass that 
matter by  

i know of only four published outlines of the great 
sperm whale   colnett s  huggins s  frederick cuvier  s  
and beale s  in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier 
have been referred to  huggins s is far better than theirs   
but  by great odds  beale s is the best  all beale s draw- 
ings of this whale are good  excepting the middle figure 
in the picture of three whales in various attitudes  capping 
his second chapter  his frontispiece  boats attacking 
sperm whales  though no doubt calculated to excite the 
civil scepticism of some parlour men  is admirably correct 
and lifelike in its general effect  some of the sperm 
whale drawings in j  ross browne are pretty correct in 
contour   but they are wretchedly engraved  that is 
not his fault  though  

of the right whale  the best outline pictures are in 
scoresby   but they are drawn on too small a scale to 
convey a desirable impression  he has but one picture 
of whaling scenes  and this is a sad deficiency  because it 
is by such pictures only  when at all well done  that you 

vol  i  y 



338 moby-dick 

can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale 
as seen by his living hunters  

but  taken for all in all  by far the finest  though in some 
details not the most correct  presentations of whales and 
whaling scenes to be anywhere found  are two large 
french engravings  well executed  and taken from paint- 
ings by one garnery  respectively  they represent 
attacks on the sperm and right whale  in the first en- 
graving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty 
of might  just risen beneath the boat from the profundities 
of the ocean  and bearing high in the air upon his back the 
terrific wreck of the stoven planks  the prow of the boat 
is partially unbroken  and is drawn just balancing upon 
the monster s spine   and standing in that prow  for that 
one single incomputable flash of time  you behold an oars- 
man  half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the 
whale  and in the act of leaping  as if from a precipice  
the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true  
the half -emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea   the 
wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it   
the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the 
whale in contrasting expressions of affright   while hi the 
black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the 
scene  serious fault might be found with the anatomical 
details of this whale  but let that pass   since  for the life 
of me  i could not draw so good a one  

in the second engraving  the boat is in the act of draw- 
ing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right 
whale  that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some 
mossy rock-slide from the patagonian cliffs  his jets 
are erect  full  and black like soot   so that from so 
abounding a smoke in the chimney  you would think there 
must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below  
sea-fowls are pecking at the small crabs  shell-fish  and 
other sea-candies and macaroni  which the right whale 



less erroneous pictures 339 

sometimes carries on his pestilent back  and all the 
while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the 
deep  leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake  
and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a 
skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer  
thus  the foreground is all raging commotion   but 
behind  in admirable artistic contrast  is the glassy 
level of a sea becalmed  the drooping unstarched sails 
of the powerless ship  and the inert mass of a dead 
whale  a conquered fortress  with the flag of capture 
lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his 
spout -hole  

who garnery the painter is  or was  i know not  but 
my life for it he was either practically conversant with his 
subject  or else marvellously tutored by some experienced 
whaleman  the french are the lads for painting action  
go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe  and where 
will you find such a gallery of living and breathing com- 
motion on canvas  as in that triumphal hall at versailles   
where the beholder fights his way  pell-mell  through the 
consecutive great battles of france   where every sword 
seems a flash of the northern lights  and the successive 
armed kings and emperors dash by  like a charge of 
crowned centaurs   not wholly unworthy of a place in 
that gallery  are those sea-battle pieces of garnery  

the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the 
picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced 
in what paintings and engravings they have of their 
whaling scenes  with not one tenth of england s experi- 
ence in the fishery  and not the thousandth part of that 
of the americans  they have nevertheless furnished both 
nations with the only finished sketches at all capable 
of conveying the real spirit of the whale-hunt  for the 
most part  the english and american whale draughtsmen 
seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical 



340 moby-dick 

outline of things  such as the vacant profile of the whale   
which  so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned  is 
about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid  
even scoresby  the justly renowned right whaleman  
after giving us a stiff full-length of the greenland whale  
and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and 
porpoises  treats us to a series of classical engravings of 
boat-hooks  chopping-knives  and grapnels   and with the 
microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the 
inspection of a shivering world ninety-six facsimiles of 
magnified arctic snow crystals  i mean no disparagement 
to the excellent voyager  i honour him for a veteran   but 
in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not 
to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken 
before a greenland justice of the peace  

in addition to those fine engravings from garnery  there 
are two other french engravings worthy of note  by some- 
one who subscribes himself   h  durand   one of them  
though not precisely adapted to our present purpose  
nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts  it is a 
quiet noon-scene among the isles of the pacific   a french 
whaler anchored  inshore  in a calm  and lazily taking 
water on board   the loosened sails of the ship  and the 
long leaves of the palms in the background  both drooping 
together in the breezeless air  the effect is very fine  
when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy 
fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental 
repose  the other engraving is quite a different affair   
the ship hove-to upon the open sea  and in the very heart 
of the leviathanic life  with a right whale alongside   the 
vessel  in the act of cutting -in  hove over to the monster 
as if to a quay   and a boat  hurriedly pushing off from 
this scene of activity  is about giving chase to whales in 
the distance  the harpoons and lances lie levelled for 
use   three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole   



less erroneous pictures 341 

while from a sudden roll of the sea  the little craft stands 
half -erect out of the water  like a rearing horse  from 
the ship  the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale 
is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies   and 
to windward  a black cloud  rising up with earnest of 
squalls and rains  seems to quicken the activity of the

of whales in paint   in teeth   in wood   in sheet-

on tower hill  as you go down to the london docks  you 
may have seen a crippled beggar  or kedger  as the sailors 
say  holding a painted board before him  representing 
the tragic scene in which he lost his leg  there are three 
whales and three boats   and one of the boats  presumed 
to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity  is 
being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale  any 
time these ten years  they tell me  has that man held up 
that picture  and exhibited that stump to an incredulous 
world  but the time of his justification has now come  
his three whales are as good whales as were ever published 
in wapping  at any rate   and his stump as unquestion- 
able a stump as any you will find in the western clearings  
but  though forever mounted on that stump  never a 
stump-speech does the poor whaleman make   but  with 
downcast eyes  stands ruefully contemplating his own 
amputation  

throughout the pacific  and also in nantucket  and 
new bedford  and sag harbour  you will come across 
lively sketches of whales and whaling scenes  graven by 
the fishermen themselves on sperm whale-teeth  or ladies  
busks wrought out of the right whalebone  and other like 
skrimshander articles  as the whalemen call the numerous 
little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out 
of the rough material  in their hours of ocean leisure  
some of them have little boxes of dentistical-looking 

342

implements  specially intended for the skrimshandering 
business  but  in general  they toil with their jack- 
knives alone   and  with that almost omnipotent tool of 
the sailor  they will turn you out anything you please  
in the way of a mariner s fancy  

long exile from christendom and civilisation inevitably 
restores a man to that condition in which god placed him  
i e  what is called savagery  your true whale-hunter is as 
much a savage as an iroquois  i myself am a savage  
owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals   
and ready at any moment to rebel against him  

now  one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage 
in his domestic hours  is his wonderful patience of industry  
an ancient hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle  in its full 
multiplicity and elaboration of carving  is as great a 
trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon  for  
with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark s tooth  that 
miraculous intricacy of wooden net work has been achieved   
and it has cost steady years of steady application  

as with the hawaiian savage  so with the white sailor- 
savage  with the same marvellous patience  and with 
the same single shark s tooth  of his one poor jack-knife  
he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture  not quite as 
workmanlike  but as close packed in its maziness of 
design  as the greek savage  achilles s shield   and full 
of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness  as the prints of that 
fine old dutch savage  albert durer  

wooden whales  or whales cut in profile out of the 
small dark slabs of the noble south sea war-wood  are 
frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers  
some of them are done with much accuracy  

at some old gable-roofed country houses you will see 
brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside 
door  when the porter is sleepy  the anvil-headed whale 
would be best  but these knocking whales are seldom

remarkable as faithful essays  on the spires of some old- 
fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed 
there for weather-cocks   but they are so elevated  and 
besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled 
with   hands off     you cannot examine them closely 
enough to decide upon their merit  

in bony  ribby regions of the earth  where at the base 
of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic 
groupings upon the plain  you will often discover images 
as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged 
in grass  which of a windy day breaks against them in a 
surf of green surges  

then  again  in mountainous countries where the 
traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical 
heights   here and there from some lucky point of view 
you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales 
defined along the undulating ridges  but you must be a 
thorough whaleman  to see these sights   and not only 
that  but if you wish to return to such a sight again  you 
must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and 
longitude of your first standpoint  else so chance-like are 
such observations of the hills  that your precise  previous 
standpoint would require a laborious rediscovery   like 
the soloma islands  which still remain incognita  though 
once high-ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera 
chronicled them  

nor when expandingly lifted by your subject  can you 
fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens  and 
boats in pursuit of them   as when long filled with 
thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked 
in battle among the clouds  thus at the north have i 
chased leviathan round and round the pole with the 
revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to 
me  and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have 
boarded the argo-navis  and joined the chase against 



whales variously represented 345 

the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydras 
and the flying fish  

with a frigate s anchors for my bridle -bits and fasces 
of harpoons for spurs  would i could mount that whale 
and leap the topmost skies  to see whether the fabled 
heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped 
beyond my mortal sight

steering north-eastward from the crozetts  we fell in with 
vast meadows of brit  the minute  yellow substance upon 
which the right whale largely feeds  for leagues and 
leagues it undulated round us  so that we seemed to be 
sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat  

on the second day  numbers of right whales were seen  
who  secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the 
pequod  with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit  
which  adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous 
venetian blind in their mouths  was in that manner 
separated from the water that escaped at the lip  

as morning mowers  who side by side slowly arid 
seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet 
grass of marshy meads   even so these monsters swam  
making a strange  grassy  cutting sound   and leaving 
behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow 
sea  1 

but it was only the sound they made as they parted 
the brit which at all reminded one of mowers  seen from 
the mast-heads  especially when they paused and were 
stationary for a while  their vast black forms looked more 
like lifeless masses of rock than anything else  and as 
in the great hunting countries of india  the stranger at a 

1 that part of the sea known among whalemen as the   brazil banks   
does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do  because of 
there being shallows and soundings there  but because of this remarkable 
meadow-like appearance  caused by the vast drifts of brit continually 
floating in those latitudes  where the right whale is often chased

distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent 
elephants without knowing them to be such  taking them 
for bare  blackened elevations of the soil   even so  often  
with him who for the first time beholds this species of 
the leviathans of the sea  and even when recognised at 
last  their immense magnitude renders it very hard really 
to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can 
possibly be instinct  in all parts  with the same sort of life 
that lives in a dog or a horse  

indeed  in other respects  you can hardly regard any 
creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do 
those of the shore  for though some old naturalists have 
maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind 
in the sea   and though taking a broad general view of 
the thing  this may very well be   yet coming to specialities  
where  for example  does the ocean furnish any fish that 
in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the 
dog   the accursed shark alone can in any generic 
respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him  

but though  to landsmen in general  the native in- 
habitants of the seas have ever been regarded with 
emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling   though we 
know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita  so that 
columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to 
discover his one superficial western one   though  by vast 
odds  the most terrific of all mortal disasters have im- 
memorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and 
hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the 
waters   though but a moment s consideration will teach  
that however baby man may brag of his science and skill  
and however much  in a flattering future  that science and 
skill may augment   yet forever and forever  to the crack 
of doom  the sea will insult and murder him  and pulverise 
the stateliest  stiffest frigate he can make   nevertheless  
by the continual repetition of these very impressions

man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea 
which aboriginally belongs to it  

the jirst boat we read of  floated on an ocean  that with 
portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world with- 
out leaving so much as a widow  that same ocean rolls 
now   that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of 
last year  yea  foolish mortals  noah s flood is not yet 
subsided   two -thirds of the fair world it yet covers  

wherein differ the sea and the land  that a miracle 
upon one is not a miracle upon the other   preternatural 
terrors rested upon the hebrews  when under the feet of 
korah and his company the live ground opened and 
swallowed them up forever   yet not a modern sun ever 
sets  but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows 
up ships and crews  

but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien 
to it  but it is also a fiend to its own offspring   worse than 
the persian host who murdered his own guests   sparing 
not the creatures which itself hath spawned  like a 
savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her 
own cubs  so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales 
against the rocks  and leaves them there side by side with 
the split wrecks of ships  no mercy  no power but its 
own controls it  panting and snorting like a mad battle- 
steed that has lost its rider  the masterless ocean overruns 
the globe  

consider the subtleness of the sea   how its most 
dreaded creatures glide under water  unapparent for the 
most part  and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest 
tints of azure  consider also the devilish brilliance and 
beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes  as the 
dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks  
consider  once more  the universal cannibalism of the 
sea   all whose creatures prey upon each other  carrying 
on eternal war since the world began  



brit 349 

consider all this   and then turn to this green  gentle  
and most docile earth   consider them both  the sea 
and the land   and do you not find a strange analogy to 
something in yourself   for as this appalling ocean 
surrounds the verdant land  so in the soul of man there 
lies one insular tahiti  full of peace and joy  but encom- 
passed by all the horrors of the half -known life  god 
keep thee   push not off from that isle  thou canst never 
return

squid 

slowly wading through the meadows of brit  the pequod 
still held on her way north-eastward toward the island 
of java   a gentle air impelling her keel  so that in the 
surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly 
waved to that languid breeze  as three mild palms on a 
plain  and still  at wide intervals in the silvery night  
the lonely  alluring jet would be seen  

but one transparent blue morning  when a stillness 
almost preternatural spread over the sea  however un- 
attended with any stagnant calm   when the long bur- 
nished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger 
laid across them  enjoining some secrecy   when the 
slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on   
in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre 
was seen by daggoo from the mainmast-head  

in the distance  a great white mass lazily rose  and rising 
higher and higher  and disentangling itself from the azure  
at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide  new slid 
from the hills  thus glistening for a moment  as slowly 
it subsided  and sank  then once more arose  and silently 
gleamed  it seemed not a whale   and yet is this moby- 
dick   thought daggoo  again the phantom went down  
but on reappearing once more  with a stiletto-like cry that 
startled every man from his nod  the negro yelled out 
4 there   there again   there she breaches   right ahead   
the white whale  the white whale     

upon this  the seamen rushed to the yard-arms  as in 
swarming-time the bees rush to the boughs  bareheaded 
in the sultry sun  ahab stood on the bowsprit  and with one

hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to 
the helmsman  cast his eager glance in the direction indi- 
cated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo  

whether the flitting attendance of the one still and 
solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab  so that he 
was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and 
repose with the first sight of the particular whale he 
pursued   however this was  or whether his eagerness 
betrayed him   whichever way it might have been  no 
sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass  than with 
a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering  

the four boats were soon on the water   ahab s in 
advance  and all swiftly pulling toward their prey  soon 
it went down  and while  with oars suspended  we were 
awaiting its reappearance  lo   in the same spot where it 
sank  once more it slowly rose  almost forgetting for 
the moment all thoughts of moby-dick  we now gazed 
at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas 
have hitherto revealed to mankind  a vast pulpy mass  
furlongs in length and breadth  of a glancing cream-colour  
lay floating on the water  innumerable long arms radiating 
from its centre  and curling and twisting like a nest of 
anacondas  as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object 
within reach  no perceptible face or front did it have   
no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct   but 
undulated there on the billows  an unearthly  formless  
chance-like apparition of life  

as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again  
starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had 
sunk  with a wild voice exclaimed   almost rather had 
i seen moby-dick and fought him  than to have seen thee  
thou white ghost     

  what was it  sir     said flask  

  the great live squid  which  they say  few whale-ships 
ever beheld  and returned to their ports to tell of it   



352 moby-dick 

but ahab said nothing   turning his boat  he sailed 
back to the vessel   the rest as silently following  

whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general 
have connected with the sight of this object  certain it is  
that a glimpse of it being so very unusual  that circum- 
stance has gone far to invest it with portent ousness  so 
rarely is it beheld  that though one and all of them declare 
it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean  yet very 
few of them have any but the most vague ideas concern- 
ing its true nature and form   notwithstanding  they 
believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food  
for though other species of whales find their food above 
water  and may be seen by man in the act of feeding  the 
spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown 
zones below the surface   and  only by inference is it 
that any one can tell of what  precisely  that food consists  
at times  when closely pursued  he will disgorge what are 
supposed to be the detached arms of the squid   some of 
them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in 
length  they fancy that the monster to which these arms 
belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean   
and that the sperm whale  unlike other species  is supplied 
with teeth in order to attack and tear it  

there seems some ground to imagine that the great 
kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve 
itself into squid  the manner in which the bishop de- 
scribes it  as alternately rising and sinking  with some 
other particulars he narrates  in all this the two corre- 
spond  but much abatement is necessary with respect 
to the incredible bulk he assigns it  

by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumours 
of the mysterious creature  here spoken of  it is included 
among the class of cuttle-fish  to which  indeed  in certain 
external respects it would seem to belong  but only as the 
anak of the tribe  



chapter lx 

the line 

with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be de- 
scribed  as well as for the better understanding of all 
similar scenes elsewhere presented  i have here to speak 
of the magical  sometimes horrible whale-line  

the line originally used in the fishery was of the best 
hemp  slightly vapoured with tar  not impregnated with 
it  as in the case of ordinary ropes   for while tar  as 
ordinarily used  makes the hemp more pliable to the rope- 
maker  and also renders the rope itself more convenient 
to the sailor for common ship use   yet  not only would 
the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for 
the close coiling to which it must be subjected   but as 
most seamen are beginning to learn  tar in general by 
no means adds to the rope s durability or strength  how- 
ever much it may give it compactness and gloss  

of late years the manilla rope has in the american 
fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material 
for whale-lines   for  though not so durable as hemp  it 
is stronger  and far more soft and elastic   and i will add 
 since there is an aesthetics in all things   is much more 
handsome and becoming to the boat  than hemp  hemp 
is a dusky  dark fellow  a sort of indian   but manilla 
is as a golden-haired circassian to behold  

the whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness  
at first sight  you would not think it so strong as it really 
is  by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each sus- 
pend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds   so

that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three 
tons  in length  the common sperm whale-line measures 
something over two hundred fathoms  toward the 
stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub  not 
like the worm-pipe of a still though  but so as to form one 
round  cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded  sheaves   
or layers of concentric spiralisations  without any hollow 
but the  heart  or minute vertical tube formed at the 
axis of the cheese  as the least tangle or kink in the 
coiling would  in running out  infallibly take somebody s 
arm  leg  or entire body off  the utmost precaution is 
used in stowing the line in its tub  some harpooneers 
will consume almost an entire morning in this business  
carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downward 
through a block toward the tub  so as in the act of coiling 
to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists  

in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one   
the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs  
there is some advantage in this   because these twin -tubs 
being so small they fit more readily into the boat  and do 
not strain it so much   whereas  the american tub  nearly 
three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth  makes 
a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but 
one half-inch in thickness   for the bottom of the whale- 
boat is like critical ice  which will bear up a considerable 
distributed weight  but not very much of a concentrated 
one  when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the 
american line-tub  the boat looks as if it were pulling off 
with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the 
whales  

both ends of the line are exposed   the lower end 
terminating in an eye -splice or loop coming up from the 
bottom against the side of the tub  and hanging over 
its edge completely disengaged from everything  this 
arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts  



the line 355 

first   in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an 
additional line from a neighbouring boat  in case the 
stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to 
carry off the entire line originally attached to the har- 
poon  in these instances  the whale of course is shifted 
like a mug of ale  as it were  from the one boat to the 
other   though the first boat always hovers at hand to 
assist its consort  second   this arrangement is indis- 
pensable for common safety s sake   for were the lower 
end of the line in any way attached to the boat  and were 
the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a 
single  smoking minute as he sometimes does  he would 
not stop there  for the doomed boat would infallibly 
be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea   
and in that case no town -crier would ever find her again  

before lowering the boat for the chase  the upper end 
of the line is taken aft from the tub  and passing round the 
logger-head there  is again carried forward the entire 
length of the boat  resting crosswise upon the loom or 
handle of every man s oar  so that it jogs against his wrist 
in rowing   and also passing between the men  as they 
alternately sit at the opposite gunwales  to the leaded 
chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat  
where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill  
prevents it from slipping out  from the chocks it hangs 
in a slight festoon over the bows  and is then passed inside 
the boat again   and some ten or twenty fathoms  called 
box-line  being coiled upon the box in the bows  it con- 
tinues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft  and 
is then attached to the short -warp the rope which is 
immediately connected with the harpoon   but previous 
to that connection  the short -warp goes through sundry 
mystifications too tedious to detail  

thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its compli- 
cated coils  twisting and writhing around it in almost 



356 moby-dick 

every direction  all the oarsmen are involved in its 
perilous contortions   so that to the timid eye of the 
landsman  they seem as indian jugglers  with the deadliest 
snakes sportively festooning their limbs  nor can any 
son of mortal woman  for the first time  seat himself amid 
those hempen intricacies  and while straining his utmost 
at the oar  bethink him that at any unknown instant the 
harpoon may be darted  and all these horrible contortions 
be put in play like ringed lightnings   he cannot be thus 
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very 
marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly  
yet habit strange thing   what cannot habit accom- 
plish   gayer sallies  more merry mirth  better jokes  
and brighter repartees  you never heard over your 
mahogany  than you will hear over the half-inch white 
cedar of the whale-boat  when thus hung in hangman s 
nooses   and  like the six burghers of calais before king 
edward  the six men composing the crew pull into the 
jaws of death  with a halter around every neck  as you 
may say  

perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to 
account for those repeated whaling disasters some few 
of which are casually chronicled of this man or that man 
being taken out of the boat by the line  and lost  for  
when the line is darting out  to be seated then in the boat 
is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings 
of a steam-engine in full play  when every flying beam  
and shaft  and wheel  is grazing you  it is worse   for 
you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils  
because the boat is rocking like a cradle  and you are 
pitched one way and the other  without the slightest 
warning   and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy 
and simultaneousness of volition and action can you 
escape being made a mazeppa of  and run away with where 
the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out  



the line 357 

again   as the profound calm which only apparently 
precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more 
awful than the storm itself   for  indeed  the calm 
is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm   and con- 
tains it in itself  as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the 
fatal powder  and the ball  and the explosion   so the 
graceful repose of the line  as it silently serpentines about 
the oarsmen before being brought into actual play this 
is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other 
aspect of this dangerous affair  but why say more   
all men live enveloped in whale -lines  all are born with 
halters round their necks   but it is only when caught 
in the swift  sudden turn of death  that mortals realise 
the silent  subtle  ever-present perils of life  and if you 
be a philosopher  though seated in the whale-boat  you 
would not at heart feel one whit more of terror  than 
though seated before your evening fire with a poker  and 
not a harpoon  by your side
